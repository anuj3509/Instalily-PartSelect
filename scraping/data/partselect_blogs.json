A hot compressor is typically caused by dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning fan motor, a faulty thermostat, or low refrigerant levels. It can also be caused by something as simple as overloading the fridge with groceries or placing the fridge too close to the wall.  Understanding the root causes of a hot compressor is essential to maintaining your refrigerator’s efficiency and longevity. In this article, we'll explore the common reasons behind a hot refrigerator compressor, and practical step-by-step solutions to help you resolve the issue, and ensure your refrigerator runs smoothly and keeps your food fresh.\n\nWhat Does the Compressor Do in a Refrigerator?\nThe compressor is a crucial part of the refrigeration cycle, which is the process whereby heat is removed from inside the refrigerator to keep it cool. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, which is converted into a liquid when it passes through the condenser coils. The liquid evaporates and absorbs heat from the interior of the fridge and cools it down. The cooled air is then circulated throughout the refrigerator to keep the food items cold. The gas returns to the compressor where it begins this cycle again. In summary, the compressor is responsible for pressurizing and circulating the refrigerant throughout the refrigeration system and facilitating the removal of heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside environment.\n\nIf the compressor overheats, it may be unable to compress refrigerant gas effectively, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and longer cooling cycles. It will also consume more energy as it struggles to maintain the desired temperature inside the refrigerator. This can lead to higher electricity bills and unnecessary energy use. Furthermore, overheating over a long period of time can damage the internal components of the compressor, such as the motor windings, and electrical connections. Over time, this can lead to premature compressor failure and the need for costly repairs. If the compressor continues to overheat, it may eventually fail completely. A failed compressor can cause the entire refrigeration system to stop working, leaving your refrigerator unable to function at all. Therefore, if you notice that your compressor is getting hotter than usual, you should address this promptly.\n\nHow Dirty Refrigerator Condenser Coils Lead to a Hot Compressor\nThe condenser coils are designed to release heat generated from inside the refrigerator. When these coils are covered in dust, dirt, or debris, they will be unable to carry out this function efficiently and the overall temperature of the refrigeration system increases. As a result, the compressor has to work harder and run more frequently to maintain the desired internal temperature. Over time, this constant strain can cause the compressor to overheat, increase energy costs, and lower the overall efficiency of the refrigerator.\n\nHow to Clean Condenser Coils to Fix a Hot Compressor\n\nBefore you begin cleaning, unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to avoid electric shock.\nYou can typically find the condenser coil either on the back of the refrigerator or underneath the door behind a grille.\n If the coils are at the bottom, you may need to remove the access panel or grille covering them. This may involve unscrewing a few screws or simply snapping off the grille, depending on your refrigerator model.\nOnce you have access to the coils, use a coil cleaning brush or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any dirt or debris. Be careful to avoid damaging the coils.\nFor any hard-to-reach areas where dust may accumulate, you can use a narrow brush or a can of compressed air to reach these areas.\nOnce the coils are clean and you've inspected them for damage, reassemble any panels or grilles you removed and plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet.\n\n\nHow a Faulty Refrigerator Thermostat Leads to a Hot Compressor\nThe thermostat is designed to monitor the internal temperature of the refrigerator and signal the compressor to turn on or off to maintain the correct temperature. If the thermostat is faulty, it may not accurately read the temperature inside the refrigerator. It may continuously signal the compressor to run even if the temperature is already at the desired level. When the compressor runs continuously without the necessary breaks, it can lead to the compressor becoming extremely hot as it is constantly working to cool down the refrigerator. You will need to replace the refrigerator thermostat to restore the proper functioning of your appliance.\n\nHow to Replace a Thermostat to Fix a Hot Compressor\n\nUnplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to ensure your safety.\nThe thermostat is typically located behind the control panel inside the refrigerator compartment. Refer to your refrigerator's user manual to locate the thermostat.\nDepending on the model, you may need to remove the control panel to access the thermostat. This usually involves unscrewing a few screws and gently prying off the panel. Be careful not to damage any wires or components.\nCarefully disconnect the wires connected to it. Take note of where each wire is connected or take a picture for reference later.\nUse a multimeter to test the thermostat for continuity. If it shows no continuity at its coldest setting, it may be defective and needs replacement.\nUnscrew the thermostat from its mounting bracket or housing. Keep track of the screws and any other fasteners.\nPosition the new thermostat in place and secure it with the screws. Make sure it's properly aligned and seated in the mounting bracket.\nReconnect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new thermostat. Double-check that each wire is securely connected and in the correct position.\nIf you removed the control panel, carefully reattach it to the refrigerator. Secure any screws or fasteners to ensure it's firmly in place.\n Plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet and turn it on. Test the thermostat to ensure it's working properly.\n\n\nHow a Faulty Refrigerator Condenser Fan Motor Leads to a Hot Compressor\nThe condenser fan motor is responsible for cooling the condenser coils and the compressor by circulating air over them, which helps diffuse the heat generated during the refrigeration cycle. If the condenser fan motor fails or operates inefficiently, it can cause inadequate cooling of the condenser coils and compressor. This lack of proper cooling can lead to the compressor overheating. If you are in need of a new refrigerator fan motor you can browse our list of genuine OEM replacement parts to find the right one for your model. \n\nHow to Replace a Fridge Fan Motor to Fix a Hot Compressor\n\nLocate the fan motor in a cabinet at the bottom of the fridge, near the compressor and condenser coils.\nVisually inspect the fan motor for any signs of damage, such as burnt wires, excessive dirt or debris buildup, or unusual noise when running. If the fan motor appears damaged or is not running properly, it may need to be replaced.\nRemove the fan cover to access the motor.\nOnce you have access to the fan motor, carefully disconnect the wires connected to it. Take note of where each wire is connected or take a picture for reference later.\nUnscrew the fan motor from its mounting bracket or housing.\nPosition the new fan motor in place and secure it with the screws. Make sure it's properly aligned and seated in the mounting bracket.\nReconnect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new fan motor. Double-check that each wire is securely connected and in the correct position.\nIf you removed a back panel to access the fan motor, carefully reattach the panel to the refrigerator. Secure any screws or clips to ensure it's firmly in place.\nPlug the refrigerator back into the power outlet and turn it on.\n\n\nHow an Overloaded Refrigerator Leads to a Hot Compressor \nWhen a refrigerator is overcrowded or items are haphazardly placed, it can cause uneven cooling within the compartments, resulting in the compressor running for longer. Additionally, when items are closely packed in together or poorly arranged, it can hinder the airflow through the appliances. The compressor also has to work harder to cool a larger number of items. This forces the refrigerator to work harder to distribute cool air, putting additional strain on the compressor.\n\nHow to Store Food Items to Prevent Overheating Compressor \n\nKeep Air Vents Clear: Make sure that air vents inside the refrigerator are not blocked by food items. This allows for proper airflow and efficient cooling.\nAvoid Overloading: Do not overload the refrigerator with too many items. Leave space between items so that cool air can circulate freely.\nGroup Similar Items Together: Organize similar items together to minimize the time the refrigerator door is open. This can help to reduce the amount of warm air that enters the refrigerator and reduces the loss of cool air.\nRegularly Clean and Declutter: Regularly remove old, expired or unused items to maintain an organized and efficient refrigerator.\n\n\nHow Low Voltage Supply to a Refrigerator Leads to a Hot Compressor \nWhen the compressor motor receives low voltage, it operates at a lower speed than it is designed for. This reduced speed can lead to decreased efficiency, causing the compressor to work harder to maintain the desired cooling temperature. As a result, the compressor generates more heat. Low voltage can also lead to the overloading of various components within the compressor, such as the motor windings and electrical connections, which also results in increased heat production. Over time, the excessive heat buildup can lead to overheating of the compressor.\n\nHow to Check for Loose Wiring Near Refrigerator Compressor \n\nUnplug the refrigerator from the power outlet before you begin any inspection.\nThe compressor is a large cylindrical component found at the back of the refrigerator, near the bottom. Remove the back panel or grille by unscrewing any screws holding it in place.\nLook for any visible signs of damage or loose connections in the wiring attached to the compressor.\nGently tug on the wires to ensure they are securely connected to the compressor terminals.\nCheck for any burnt or frayed wires, which could indicate a problem.\nCheck the relay and overload protector which are the two components attached to the compressor.\nRemove these components carefully to inspect the wiring underneath. Ensure the connections are tight and there are no signs of corrosion or damage.\nOnce you have inspected and ensured all connections are secure, reattach the relay and overload protector.\nReattach the back panel or grille, and secure it with the screws.\nPlug the refrigerator back into the power outlet.\n\n\nHow a Poorly Positioned Refrigerator Leads to a Hot Compressor \nIf the refrigerator is too close to the wall, airflow around the condenser coils will become restricted. As a result, the condenser coils cannot effectively release heat, causing the compressor to work harder to maintain the desired temperature inside the fridge. Furthermore, as the compressor struggles to maintain the desired temperature due to the heat buildup, the refrigerator's cooling performance may be compromised. The food items inside the fridge may not be cooled adequately, and the fridge may run longer and more frequently to achieve the set temperature, resulting in higher energy consumption.\nTo prevent a hot compressor caused by a fridge being too close to the wall, ensure there is sufficient space around the refrigerator for proper airflow. Pull the fridge forward and leave at least a few inches of clearance between the back of the fridge and the wall, as well as between the sides of the fridge and any nearby objects.\n\nHow Low Refrigerant Levels Lead to a Hot Compressor  \nRefrigerant is responsible for cooling various components of the fridge, including the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator to facilitate the cooling process. It absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator and releases it outside. When the system lacks sufficient refrigerant, the fridge will be unable to function optimally, leading to overheating and reduced cooling efficiency. Some refrigerants are toxic when inhaled and exposure to high concentrations of these refrigerants can cause dizziness, nausea, and respiratory issues. Refrigerants are also highly flammable and therefore pose a serious fire hazard. It is recommended to avoid addressing this issue on your own and to consult a qualified technician who can check the refrigerant levels and refill them if required.\n\nUnderstanding why your fridge compressor may be overheating is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and longevity of your refrigerator. By regularly inspecting and addressing these issues, you can prevent compressor overheating and extend the lifespan of your refrigerator. Simple maintenance tasks like cleaning condenser coils, ensuring proper ventilation around the fridge, and checking refrigerant levels can help alleviate the problem. Remember, a well-maintained compressor leads to a cooler, more efficient fridge, ultimately saving you both energy and money in the long run.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

A circuit issue can cause the motor to not start, or alternatively it can result in your dryer not turning off. This indicates that a relay may be stuck on the main control board, which can cause the motor to continuously run. This could lead to premature wear on your motor, along with becoming a safety issue, if not corrected. In this article we’ll walk you through the steps of troubleshooting and correcting a 3C error code on your Samsung dryer.\n\nResetting a Samsung Dryer to Clear a 3C Error Code\n\nAs per Samsung, the 3C error code does not have a specific troubleshooting process beyond restarting the machine. To restart your dryer, follow these steps:\n\nTurn off your dryer by disconnecting the power source.\nAfter waiting at least 3 minutes, plug the dryer back in and turn it on.\nRestart the cycle and check to ensure the code has been cleared.\n\n\nParts to Inspect on Your Samsung Dryer\nIf you continue to get the 3C code after performing the recommended reset, check the components listed below in the order they are listed. “It should be noted that fault codes indicate an issue or symptom, but they don’t tell the full story,” says our in-house repair technician Chris Boyle. “So, while the 3C error code tells us there is a motor issue, further inspection is needed to determine what exactly is causing the problem if a hard reset doesn’t work.” Before beginning any inspections or repairs, be sure to disconnect the power supply to the dryer.\n\nCheck for Loose Wiring\n\nThe first item to inspect are the wire harnesses connected to the control board. It is possible that a wire is not properly connected, leading to the communication issues between the control board and the motor.\n\nHow to Inspect the Wiring on the Electronic Control Board of a Samsung Dryer\n\nIf you haven’t already, begin by unplugging the dryer or turning off the appropriate breaker.\nThe dryer will need to be pulled out from the wall so that the screws at the back can be accessed and removed, allowing you to remove the top panel from the main dryer cabinet.\nWith the top of the dryer removed, you can now access the housing for the main control board. Remove the screws holding the housing in place and flip it over so that you can inspect the board and wiring harnesses.\nCheck that the wires are securely in place, and if any are loose or not fully secure to the terminals, push them back into place.\nYou can now reinstall the control board, housing, and top lid of the dryer and plug it back. Turn it on and run a cycle to confirm the loose wiring was the cause of your 3C error code.\n\n \nSamsung Dryer Electronic Control Board\n\nIf resetting the dryer and checking the wire connections didn’t clear the 3C error code, the Samsung user manuals indicate that “the PBA needs to be checked.”  The electronic control board, which Samsung refers to as a PBA (Printed Board Assembly), is also known as a circuit board and it communicates the various functions to the different parts of your dryer. If the PBA is faulty, there may be relays that are stuck, resulting in your dryer either running continuously, or the motor not running at all. To accurately diagnose an issue with the control board, you will need a multimeter and the wiring diagram for your specific dryer model.  Reading a wiring diagram, then testing and adjusting the relays is a more advance task, which may require an appliance tech for this step. However if it’s confirmed that the control board is faulty, replacing it is a straightforward repair to DIY.\n\nHow to Replace an Electronic Control Board on Your Samsung Dryer\n\nBegin by unplugging the dryer or turning off the appropriate breaker.\nPull the dryer out from the wall so that the screws at the back can be accessed and removed, allowing you to remove the top panel from the main dryer cabinet.\nWith the top of the dryer removed, you can now access the housing for the main control board. Remove the screws holding the housing in place and flip it over so that you can access the board and the various wire harnesses. We suggest taking a photo of the current set up, so that you can reconnect the wires to the new control board in the correct locations.\nDisconnect the wire harnesses by pressing down on the locking tabs, or by pulling the wires off the terminals. When removing any wiring, be sure to pull from the connectors and not the wires themselves. Pliers may be necessary if the connectors are snug.\nThe old control board can now be discarded and the new one installed by reconnecting the various wiring harnesses.\nYou can now reassemble your dryer by reconnecting the control board housing and reinstalling the top panel to the cabinet.\n\n \n \n\n \n\nSamsung Dryer Drive Motor\n\nIf issues with one of the above components has caused your motor to fail, the steps below will walk you through the repair. To keep your motor running efficiently in the future, it is important not to overload your dryer by placing excessively wet and heavy laundry inside. This causes the motor to work harder to tumble your laundry and will wear the motor prematurely. With the motor being located at the bottom of the dryer, it will require you to disassemble the majority of the dryer in order to complete this repair.\n\nHow to Inspect a Drive Motor on Your Samsung Dryer\n\nYou can begin by physically inspecting the motor to see if it turns freely. If it is seized or difficult to turn, or it turns but makes a bunch of noise, the motor will need to be replaced. If the motor turns freely when you spin it, but your dryer wasn’t running, you can then test the motor with a multimeter.\n\nTesting the dryer motor with a multimeter will tell you if it’s failed due to electrical reasons. Put your multimeter on the resistance or continuity setting, and have it emit a sound when the test is performed. Your dryer motor will have a start winding, and a run winding, and we’ll test both to see if either has failed. When you connect the probes to the different windings, the multimeter should make a noise to indicate there is continuity. If there is no beeping sound, the winding has failed, and the motor will need to be replaced.\n\nHow to Replace a Drive Motor on Your Samsung Dryer\n\nBegin by unplugging the dryer or turning off the appropriate breaker and pulling the dryer out from the wall so you can access the back of it.\nThe top of the dryer is the first piece to remove. Do this by removing the screws located at the back of the machine. With the screws removed, you can now slide the top off and place it out of the way.\nNext, remove the control panel from the front of the machine by unscrewing the panel from the support bracket. Disconnect the wire harness and set the console to the side.\nTo remove the front panel from the dryer, remove the screws down by the lint filter, and then remove the top screws connecting the panel to the support bracket. Disengage the spring clings at the top, disconnect the door switch wire harness, and lift the front panel off the cabinet and set it aside.\nThe support bracket can now be removed by taking out the screws connecting it to the main cabinet. This will expose a wire harness which can also be disconnected and moved to the side of the dryer. The dryer sensor wire harness at the bottom of the cabinet can also be disconnected.\nTo remove the front bulkhead, remove the screws from the support bracket, then lift on the bulkhead to remove it from the machine and set it aside.\nThe next step is to remove the drum from the dryer cabinet. To do this, first loosen the belt by pushing in the tension spring and sliding the belt off the motor and idler pulleys. You can then use the belt to help lift the drum up and pull it through the front of the dryer cabinet.\nWith all these parts removed, you will now have access to the dryer motor. You will need a socket at the front to remove the nut, and a wrench placed at the back of the motor to hold it in place. The motor can now be removed from the housing.\nCheck that your new drive motor has the motor pulley included. If not, transfer this from your old motor before installing the new one. Then you can reverse the above steps to reassemble your dryer.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nBy inspecting or replacing the above parts, your Samsung dryer should no longer be displaying a 3C error code and should be fully functional again! Experiencing any error code on your dryer is a frustrating experience, but with a few troubleshooting steps you’ll find that the repairs can be a straightforward DIY process. As always, if you are not comfortable performing your own electrical work, reach out to your trusted repair technician.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

A power cycle or hard reset of your Samsung washing machine by turning it off for a few minutes can fix most issues, and for models with WiFi, a quick network or factory reset may be all your washer needs to fix its problems. No matter which model you own, we'll explain how to reset your Samsung washer, so you can restore its full functionality and ensure it runs smoothly again.\n\nWhy You'd Need to Reset Your Samsung Washer\n\nClearing an error code: If your Samsung washer is displaying an error code that won't go away, sometimes resetting it can clear the error code for good. However, if the error code is persistent, like the '4C' error code, and reappears even after resetting your washer, you will need to address it and fix the underlying issue.\nControl panel isn't working: A common issue with Samsung washers and dryers is the control panel not responding to any inputs or selections you make, but resetting your washer can help to resolve this. Just make sure the control lock, also known as the child lock, is turned off before resetting your Samsung washer.\nFix washer network connection issues: Smart devices aren't perfect, and if you're having trouble connecting your Samsung washer to your smartphone app, a quick reset can prove helpful in restoring a good connection.\nSelling your Samsung washer: If you're planning on selling your Samsung washing machine, resetting it can be important to ensure your personal WiFi information is removed.\n\n\nHow to Hard Reset or Power Cycle Your Samsung Washer\nThe simplest way to reset a Samsung washer is by doing what's called a 'power cycle', also known to most people as a hard reset. Since Samsung washers lack a dedicated 'Reset' button, this method offers the quickest and most straightforward way to reset them, ensuring restoration of proper functionality in just a few simple steps, regardless of your washer model. It's worth mentioning again, however, that although performing a hard reset may temporarily remove any error codes in your washer's memory, any underlying issues with it will reoccur.\n\n\nPower down your washer and unplug it from its wall outlet.\nPress the 'Power' for 5 seconds, then wait 10 seconds, and press the 'Start/Pause' buttons for 5 seconds as well.\nWait 5 minutes, to allow for all residual electricity to discharge from your washer.\nPlug your washer back in, and turn it on.\nRun a test cycle to ensure the washer works properly.\n\n\nHow to Reset Your Samsung Washer’s Network Settings\nSamsung washers equipped with smart features such as 'SmartCare' or 'SmartThings', which can be paired with a smartphone app, may encounter occasional technical glitches that need a reset. If a basic power cycle doesn't fix the washer's connection problem with your home's network, or if you'd like to remove your network settings altogether, you can reset the washer's network settings to default, to reestablish and restore the connection.\n\n\nLocate the 'Smart Control' button on your Samsung washer.\nHold the 'Smart Control' button for 3-5 seconds, until an 'AP' code displays.\nThen, hold the 'Temp' button until an 'OK' appears on the display, and then 'AP' should appear once more.\nNow, turn off your Samsung washer.\nWhen you power the washer on again, the network settings will be reset and will need to be setup again.\n\n\nHow to Factory Reset Your Samsung Washer\nIf all else is failing to fix the issues you're having with your Samsung washer, or if you're looking to sell it and remove any of your network information, a factory reset is a surefire way to do that. However, it's important to note that performing a factory reset will delete all custom settings on it, which will need to be added again if you plan to use it.\n\n\nPower on your Samsung washer.\nPress and hold the 'Additional Functions' button for 3 seconds - this button will look like a finger pointing up and a '+' icon next to it.\nScroll or rotate the dial of the washer to right until you reach the 'Factory Reset' option.\nPress the 'O' button just next to the dial, and then turn the dial until it selects 'Ok', and press the 'O' button once more.\nYour Samsung washer will not reset and power off.\nTurn on your washer, and it will be reset as if it were brand new.\n\n\nNow that you know why and how to reset your Samsung washer, it should be fully functional and ready to tackle whatever laundry needs you have. Or if you were planning to sell your Samsung washer, you've been able to successfully remove all your personal network information from it. Whether it's a malfunctioning control panel or a poor connection to your network, you're now equipped to deal with any similar issues your Samsung washing machine may have in the future. But if you see any recurring error codes, check your user manual and address them right away to avoid any damage to the washer or your home.

However, if the air is too hot, we'll explain how you can fix and prevent it from happening. If your dehumidifier is overheating your room, you can start by checking your room's temperature and the dehumidifier's water bucket, and ensuring the appliance has proper airflow and ventilation. We'll explain your dehumidifier's key parts, and provide tips for efficient performance and maintaining a comfortable living space.\n\nAre Dehumidifiers Supposed to Blow Hot Air?\n\nThe short and simple answer is yes, dehumidifiers are designed to blow air into your home that can be slightly warmer than your room's ambient temperature, which may somewhat increase the overall temperature and make it feel warmer. A dehumidifier works by pulling moist air over its evaporator coils and cooling it into water droplets. These water droplets are then collected in a bucket that you empty or that drain automatically through a hose. The leftover air is then pulled over the condenser coils, which reheat it and release it back into the room. Dehumidifiers also partly produce heat as a result of their normal operation, but if your dehumidifier is blowing air that's too hot into your home, that's when there's an issue.\n\nWithin most dehumidifiers are four key parts that allow it to function, each as important for its operation as the next. These four parts are:\n\n\nCompressor: The compressor is the heart of a dehumidifier, as it is what circulates and compresses a liquid and gas called 'refrigerant' throughout the entire system, including the evaporator and condenser coils. Without a compressor, there is no moisture removal or proper heat exchange.\nEvaporator Coils: The evaporator coils are what initially absorb the hot air from your home and cool it down, so the moisture it carries condensates and turns into water droplets that are collected or drained away.\nCondenser Coils: The condenser coils release the heat absorbed by the refrigerant in the evaporator coils, and condense the refrigerant back into a fluid so it can cycle back to the evaporator coils and absorb more heat.\nFan: The fan in a dehumidifier is responsible for moving air throughout it, which is essential to the air being pulled in, cooled over the evaporator coils, and pushed back out into your home.\n\n\nHow to Prevent a Dehumidifier from Blowing Hot Air\nThe most likely cause for a dehumidifier to be blowing hot air is that it's overheating and cannot work efficiently. And now that you know how it works and its key parts, there are some fixes you can do right now to prevent your dehumidifier from being overworked and blowing hot air into your home.\n\nEnsure the Water Bucket is Empty\nThe first thing you can do to stop your dehumidifier from blowing hot air is to ensure it's in 'Dehumidify' mode, instead of 'Fan' mode. This can happen if you have your dehumidifier inadvertently set to fan mode, or after it's removed as much moisture as possible from the air, and its bucket is at full capacity. All you need to do is make sure that the collection bucket is empty, and set it back to 'Dehumidify' instead of 'Fan', and it should resume removing moisture from your living space.\n\nLower the Room Temperature\nIf a room is already warm and stuffy, using your dehumidifier may make it even warmer. Ideally, the temperature conditions for a dehumidifier are between 40 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 32 degrees Celsius). Exceeding this temperature limit will likely cause your dehumidifier to overheat. This, in turn, will make your home even warmer, decrease your dehumidifier's efficiency, and accelerate wear and tear on its parts, potentially causing refrigerant leaks. To cool the room and lower the heat of the dehumidifier air, consider also using an air conditioner for proper ventilation and air circulation. Using an air conditioner can also lower energy costs, because the cooler the home, the less the dehumidifier needs to work.\n\nMaintain Airflow for Your Dehumidifier\nDehumidifiers need proper ventilation, as any blockage makes them work harder and blow hotter air as a result. Proper airflow ensures that air does not stay in one place and is consistently circulating, which prevents your dehumidifier from overheating. Keep all sides of it clear, and at least one to two feet away from walls for optimal moisture removal performance.\n\nPerform Regular Maintenance\nA dirty air filter will restrict airflow, causing your dehumidifier to work harder and potentially overheat removing moisture from the air. Dusty coils also force the dehumidifier to work harder by reducing its ability to effectively absorb and dissipate heat. As well, a dirty dehumidifier overall can also become a breeding ground for bacteria to be dispersed throughout your home, so just like any other appliance, regular maintenance that involves cleaning (or replacing) its filter and coils with a brush or vacuum will ensure it doesn't overheat and blow hot air.\n\nProperly Turn Off Your Dehumidifier\nTo reduce the wear and tear on your dehumidifier's parts, and prevent issues like compressor problems or refrigerant leaks, turn it off using the power switch instead of unplugging it, to allow it to cool down properly. And because dehumidifiers are known to be highly energy-hungry, turn your dehumidifier off when you're not home or using it to significantly curb energy bills and extend the lifespan of its parts.\n\nDehumidifier is Running But Not Collecting Water\nIf you've explored all of the previous options and your dehumidifier is running and still blowing hot air, but not collecting water, it likely has a refrigerant or compressor issue. Refrigerant leaks and compressor failures can occur for several reasons but are normally tied to overheating and overloading of the sealed system. Because repairing a refrigerant leak or compressor failure involves handling specialized tools and toxic refrigerant, we recommend that a professional technician fixes it. Attempting to repair it yourself can be difficult and may lead to further damage to the dehumidifier, or exposure to serious safety hazards.

It is best to reset your ice maker if it is newly installed, after a power outage, or when it is experiencing system errors. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to reset your GE Profile refrigerator's ice maker, ensuring you can enjoy a steady supply of ice for your beverages. If the ice maker is still not working after a reset, you will need to inspect it further for possible faulty parts, water supply issues, or excessive ice build-up.\n\nWhen to Reset Your GE Profile Refrigerator Ice Maker\n\nDifficulties Making or Dispensing Ice: If your ice maker suddenly stops producing ice or if there is a noticeable decrease in the amount of ice produced, resetting can often resolve the issue by clearing out any minor glitches.\nPower Surge or Outage: Power interruptions can disrupt the normal operation of the refrigerator and ice maker. When the power is out, the appliance loses any stored settings or programming. Therefore, a reset is a useful way to restore its settings and resume normal operation as well as to synchronize the ice maker with other parts of the refrigerator and ensure they work well together.\nMalfunctioning Sensor: The ice maker temperature sensor helps to determine when to start the ice-making cycle. If it is experiencing an error, which can be caused by a power outage or other system failure, the ice maker may not produce any ice. Resetting the appliance can help to clear this error.\nSystem Error: A system error is typically caused by a malfunction or fault within the electronic control system. This error can show up in various ways, such as the ice maker not producing ice, producing ice of poor quality, or displaying error codes or warning lights on the control panel. The error code most commonly associated with ice maker problems is the CI error code.\n\n\nTop 3 Methods to Reset Your GE Profile Refrigerator Ice Maker\nDetermining the right method to reset your fridge ice maker depends on the specific model of your GE Profile refrigerator. However, each of the following three methods is an effective way to reset your GE Profile ice maker. You can begin with the first method and proceed to the next, if necessary, until you find the one that works best for your ice maker.\n\nPress and Hold the Reset Button\n\nLocate the reset button on the control panel of the refrigerator.\nPress and hold the button for 3- 5 seconds.\nAllow the ice maker to cycle through before attempting to dispense any ice.\n\n\nTurn the GE Ice Maker Switch Off \n\nOpen the refrigerator to access the ice maker unit.\nLocate the shut-off switch on the front of the unit and turn the switch off.\nWait several 15-30 seconds before turning the switch back on.\n\n\nPush the GE Ice Maker Paddle 3 times.\n\nLocate the shut-off switch for the ice maker and turn it off.\nYou may need to remove the ice maker tray for better access to the ice maker paddle, also known as the feeler arm or bail arm.\nWait 30 seconds to 1 minute and then turn the switch back on.\nImmediately push the ice maker paddle upwards 3 times. \nLet the ice maker cycle through before resuming use.\n\n\nCommon Causes of GE Profile Refrigerator Ice Maker Failure\nIf resetting the ice maker doesn't resolve the issue, there may be a more serious issue causing the malfunction. You can use our ice maker troubleshooting guide to help you fix your GE Profile ice maker. The most common causes of ice maker malfunctions include the following: \n\nStuck Bail Arm: The bail arm detects the amount of ice in the ice bin. Once the bin is full, the arm is pushed upwards to turn off the ice maker. The arm may become stuck in this position. If the bail arm is stuck in the engaged position the ice maker will think that the bin is full and will fail to produce any ice.\nWater Supply Issues: Problems with the water supply line, such as low water pressure, a clogged filter, or a frozen water line, can inhibit the ice maker's ability to produce ice. Resetting the ice maker won't address these issues, which may require troubleshooting and repairs to the water supply system.\nIce Jam: If there is an excessive build-up of ice in the ice bucket, the ice maker will be unable to produce or dispense more ice. Furthermore, if ice cubes get stuck between moving parts it can hinder the ice maker's ability to cycle and produce new ice and potentially damage the unit. You will need to first clear away all the built-up ice to fix the ice maker.\nMechanical Issues: The ice maker's motor, gears, or ejector blades, may be worn out, damaged, or misaligned, preventing the ice maker from operating correctly even after a reset. Additionally, damage to the ice maker's parts, such as a cracked housing or a broken seal, may prevent it from functioning properly. Resetting the ice maker won't repair physical damage. You will need to replace the faulty parts.\nElectrical Problems: Faulty electrical connections, wiring issues, or a malfunctioning control board can also prevent the ice maker from functioning properly.\nSensor Malfunctions: If the ice maker relies on sensors to detect ice levels or monitor temperature, a malfunctioning sensor can prevent it from operating correctly. Resetting the ice maker may not fix sensor-related issues, which may require calibration or replacement of the sensor.\n\n\nResetting your GE Profile ice maker can be a simple yet effective solution to many common issues that may arise, such as sudden difficulties in ice production or malfunctioning sensors. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can restore your ice maker to proper functioning. If you require new parts to get your ice maker up and running again, you can browse our list of genuine OEM GE Profile ice maker parts. With proper maintenance and occasional troubleshooting, you can keep your GE Profile ice maker running smoothly and enjoy its convenience for years to come. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer.\n\nTo begin our repair, we’re going to start by completely defrosting the freezer. Please note that any of the repair guides and videos below are general information based on a fridge with freezer on top. The steps will vary based on your appliance model and location of the freezer (such as side-by-side or on the bottom). To find the instructions for your specific freezer, please search for the model number on our YouTube channel.\n\n \n\nHow to Remove Ice or Frost Buildup from Your Freezer\n\nThe first step is to unplug the appliance.\nRemove all food from the freezer and place it into a cooler or a spare freezer. You may want to remove food from the fridge as well. However, if you place frozen blocks inside and keep the fridge door shut the entire time, your fridge content may be fine during the repair.\nNote the location of the ice or frost buildup in your freezer, then leave the freezer door open to allow it to melt.\nAs the ice softens, gently remove it with a plastic spatula or cloth. Don’t use sharp or metal tools, which can damage the inner surfaces of your freezer.\nBased on where the buildup was located, follow the recommended inspections below to determine the issue and begin your repair.\nOnce your repair is complete, you can thoroughly clean and then plug the appliance back in. Wait until the freezer comes down to temperature before replacing your food items.\n\n\nFrost on the Freezer Walls or Door\n\nIf you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or replacing the gasket.\n\nHow to Fix a Freezer Door Gasket\n\nThe first step is to visually inspect the door gasket and surrounding door area for crumbs, spills, or items that may prevent the door from sealing properly. When inspecting the gasket, check to see if it is torn, warped, or otherwise damaged.\nIf the area is dirty, use a soft, damp cloth to clean up any spills or debris. If the gasket wasn’t damaged, your freezer door should now close properly, preventing any further frost buildup.\nIf the freezer door gasket is cracked or split, it will need to be replaced. The method may vary depending on your freezer model, but it typically requires few or no tools to complete.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nFrost (or Ice) on the Back Walls\n\nThe evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first. Modern fridges have a defrost mode that cycles on, which heats up the evaporator coils to remove any frost buildup. If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure.\n\nHow to Replace a Defrost Timer\n\nThe tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver.\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power from the appliance.\nThe defrost timer will be found within the control assembly inside the refrigerator. To remove the control assembly, you may need to remove shelving from the fridge, along with the lightbulb for easier access. You will then need to remove any bolts or screws holding the control housing in place and remove it from the fridge.\nPlace the control assembly on a work surface in order to remove the defrost timer from the housing. To remove the defrost timer, you will need to disconnect the wire harness, and you may need to remove bolts or screws if the timer is secured to the control housing. A flathead screwdriver can be used to remove the wire harness if it is not easy to pull off.\nThe old defrost timer can be discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the above steps.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Defrost Heater\n\nThe tools you will likely need may include a Phillips screwdriver, putty knife, needle nose pliers, and a quarter-inch nut driver.\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance.\nThe defrost heater is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part. Remove any screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place and carefully remove the panel from the freezer.\nLocate the wire harness for the defrost timer and disconnect it. Then remove any screws or bolts from brackets that may be used to hold the heater in place.\nThe old defrost heater can be removed and discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the steps above.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nHow to Replace the Defrost Thermostat\n\nReplacing a defrost thermostat requires a bit of electric work, so you will need a pair of wire cutters and strippers, and some electrical tape or heat shrink for this repair.\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance.\nThe defrost thermostat is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part. Remove any screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place, along with any wire harnesses, and carefully remove the panel from the freezer.\nWith the evaporator exposed, you should now be able to locate the defrost thermostat. Unclip the thermostat from the evaporator and then cut the wires that are connected to the thermostat. The old thermostat can now be discarded.\nOn the new thermostat, you can cut back some of the wires and strip some of the wire insulation. Join the two sets of wires together by using a wire nut or splice. Electrical tape can then be used to keep the two wires together.\nWith the new thermostat spliced together, it can be reinstalled back on the evaporator.\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\nIce on the Bottom of the Freezer\n\nIf there is solid ice (not frost) along the bottom of your freezer, there is likely a blockage in the drain hose, causing water to back-flow into the freezer and forming the layer of ice.  The line will need to be flushed out, which can be done with compressed air.\n\nHow to Fix a Blocked Drain Hose\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting power to the appliance.\nTo clear a blocked drain line, we recommend doing so through the external drain outlet with compressed air. This won’t require much air pressure; a bicycle pump will do the trick.\nWhatever was obstructing the drain line will be blown into the freezer compartment and can be cleaned up from there.\nWith the line now clear, the appliance can be plugged back in, and future ice melting from the defrost cycle should flow down the drain line instead of into the freezer.\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\nPractical Tips to Prevent Frost Buildup\n\nNow that we’ve solved the most common issues and parts that have caused frost build-up in your freezer and cleared it out, it’s time to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Fortunately, basic changes to some of your daily habits can help prevent future frost or ice buildup in your freezer. Since warm, humid air entering the freezer causes frost to form, following these tips can help prevent any issues:\n\nLimit how often you open the fridge and freezer door.\nKeep your unit organized so you can find what you need quickly. This is key to limiting how long the door is left open.\nEnsure the door is closed tightly after each use.\nDon’t place hot food in the freezer. Allow leftovers to cool down completely before storing.\nPromptly clean up any spills, which could prevent the door gaskets from sealing properly.\nA well-stocked freezer can help maintain a consistent temperature, but make sure it isn’t crammed to allow for proper airflow.\n\n\nBy following these use-and-care tips, you can ensure that your freezer is running efficiently and frost-free. As with any repair, if it is outside of your comfort zone don’t hesitate to contact your preferred appliance repair technician.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Signs of a specific issue may include blinking lights, or starting and then stopping abruptly when filling. It's normal for dishwashers to pause mid-cycle to drain or heat water up, but there's a distinct difference between pausing and shutting off completely. Resetting your dishwasher or manually activating the drain can resolve it stopping mid-cycle, but the underlying cause must still be fixed, which means inspecting and testing a number of parts. Whether it's a simple fix like a clogged drain filter or a more complex issue like a malfunctioning door latch assembly or control board, this article will guide you through the required supplies, and instructions for diagnosing and fixing your dishwasher if it's stopping in the middle of a cycle.\n\nGeneral Problems that Cause a Dishwasher to Stop Mid-Cycle\nIt can be frustrating when your dishwasher stops mid-cycle, but understanding some general problems that can cause it will help you fix it quicker. We'll explore a few common issues, like a clogged filter and drain hose, low water pressure, and power failures, to help you resolve this stopping problem quickly and easily.\n\nClogged Filter and Drain Hose\nA dishwasher's filter and hose, which are parts of the draining system, are used to trap food particles and debris from harming valuable parts like the pump, and remove dirty water from the dishwasher. If either of these parts is clogged, blocked, or damaged, the dishwasher will stop to avoid any overflow or potential damage to your home or its parts. If you see a series of lights or an error code appear when this occurs, note it and refer to your user manual for further information on the issue.\n\nUnplug your dishwasher and turn off its water supply.\nOpen the dishwasher door and remove its filter. This may require a screwdriver or pliers to remove.\nInspect the inside of the filter and its housing for any clogs caused by gunk or debris, and use a brush or sponge, and warm soapy water to clean the filter. If the filter is damaged, replace it immediately.\nOnce the filter and its housing are cleaned, locate the dishwasher's drain hose underneath the sink, and inspect the drain hose for any clogs or foreign objects lodged inside.\nPlace a large bowl or bucket underneath the drain hose opening and disconnect it from the sink drain. Lift the hose and water should rush into the bucket if there's any left. Then use a drain brush to clean it, or replace it if necessary.\nReassemble the drain hose and filter assembly, start a cycle, and monitor it for any more stoppages.\n\n\nLow Water Pressure\nThe pressure of the water being supplied to the dishwasher is important, because if it's too weak it will cause extended filling times and poor cleaning performance. This is why many dishwashers feature sensors that can accurately detect issues with it, and will stop your dishwasher mid-cycle if not enough water is being supplied.\n\nLocate the water supply valves in your home, and inspect its gauge. The reading should be between 14.5 to 80 psi, and a rating over 116 psi would be too high.\nIf your water supply doesn't have a gauge, shut the valves closed.\nUnplug your dishwasher.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher, and disconnect one of the fill hoses. Expect some water to spill out.\nPut the fill hose into a bowl or large bucket and turn the corresponding water supply valve until it's open.\nIf the water strength going into the bowl or bucket is weak, you have an issue with your home's water supply. If the water flow is strong, continue reading this guide.\n\n\nPower Failure\nDishwashers can stop suddenly during a cycle due to power problems, either with your home or the appliance itself. Check your circuit breaker for burn marks, and the dishwasher's power cord for damage like breaks or exposed wires. If necessary, contact an electrician to properly inspect and fix your home's circuit breaker or dishwasher's power cord.\n\nWhat Parts You Need to Replace to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nWhen your dishwasher abruptly stops mid-cycle, it's often due to issues with key parts like the door latch, float switch, heating element and fuse, inlet valves, drain pump, and electronic control board. We'll walk you through how to inspect, test, and replace each of these parts, so you can effectively resolve the mid-cycle stopping problem with your dishwasher.\n\nHow to Replace a Door Latch to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nThe door latch assembly is the most common culprit for dishwashers that stop mid-cycle because the door switch, handle, and latch mechanisms ensure the safe and proper operation of the dishwasher. When these parts break or stop working properly, they can cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle due to safety triggers that interpret the door as being open. Unless there's a specific code or indication otherwise, a bad door latch assembly in some models is indicated by the dishwasher stopping mid-cycle and blinking its lights. If your door latch assembly is broken or not working, you may also notice it's easy to open, and tough to close fully.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\n\n\nPhilips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver\nSocket Wrench\nNeedle-Nose Pliers\nMultimeter\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\n\nShut off the water supply to your dishwasher.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nUnthread any screws securing your dishwasher below a countertop if necessary, then pull your dishwasher out and unplug it from its wall outlet.\nLocate the door catch on the upper portion of the dishwasher tub. If it's damaged, replace it by unthreading it and disconnecting its wire harness, and securing the new one.\nIf the door catch isn't broken, the door switch or latch may be. Start by using a screwdriver to unthread the screws around the dishwasher door's inside perimeter.\nYou should now be able to lift and separate the two halves and grab the door switch inside.\nRemove the wire harnesses from the door switch. If you notice any damage to the latch, like cracks or pieces chipped off, replace it immediately.\nLocate the door switch on the assembly, and remove it. Then with a multimeter set to ohms, touch each probe to a terminal on the switch. if you don't hear a beep, the switch does not have continuity and will need replacing.\nInstall the switch into the housing, connect its wire harnesses, and install it within the door assembly.\nThread the screws back into the door.\nBegin to carefully close the door, and monitor your dishwasher to see if the stopping issue is resolved.\n\n\nHow to Clean or Replace a Float Switch to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nThe float switch in your dishwasher is a safety device that detects water levels to prevent overflowing. Over time it can get covered in gunk or stuck, and may not be operable and able to accurately sense the level of water, causing the mid-cycle stops. We'll explain how to clean and test your dishwasher's float switch with a multimeter and replace it if needed, to get your dishwasher working again, without stoppages.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\n\n\nPhilips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver\nSocket Wrench\nNeedle-Nose Pliers\nMultimeter\nBrush or Sponge\nDrain Brush\nSoap and Warm Water\nTowels\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\n\nFirst, shut off the water supply to your dishwasher.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread and remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nDisconnect the fill hose from the inlet valve. This may require pliers and towels.\nUnthread any securing screws holding your dishwasher under your counter, pull it out, and unplug your dishwasher from the wall outlet.\nOpen the dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack, and locate the top of the float switch.\nThe switch may only be stuck, which can be fixed by moving it up and down. If it's not stuck or if you'd like to test it, remove the stem of the float switch (looks like a mushroom-top), then use a wrench to loosen any securing nuts.\nTilt the dishwasher onto its back, so you can access underneath it.\nLocate the float switch housing and remove the wire harnesses connected to the float switch to remove it.\nIf your float switch is covered in food debris or grime, clean it off with a towel and reinstall it to see if the stopping issue is resolved. Or follow the next steps to test it for continuity.\nWith a multimeter set to continuity, depress the switch and touch the two probes to the terminals on the switch. If you hear a beep, the switch is good. Release the switch and test it again; if there's a beep, the switch is bad and will need replacing.\nInstall the switch back into its housing and connect its wire harnesses.\nTilt the dishwasher back and reinstall the stem of the switch.\nReplace the dish rack and resecure your dishwasher underneath your counter, connect the fill hose, and plug the dishwasher back in.\nTurn the water supply back on before running a test cycle and seeing if that resolves your issue.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Heating Element to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nHeating elements raise the water temperature for effective dish cleaning and drying, but when a heating element fails, it may also lead to a blown fuse, disrupting the power supply and causing the dishwasher to stop abruptly. We'll help you diagnose and potentially replace a faulty heating element and blown fuse, to fix your dishwasher's mid-cycle stopping.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\n\n\nPhilips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver\nSocket Wrench\nNeedle-Nose Pliers\nMultimeter\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\n\nOpen your dishwasher door and visually inspect the heating element at the bottom of the dishwasher. If it has visible damage, like burns or breaks, it will need to be replaced.\nShut off the water valves to your dishwasher.\nUnthread and remove the kickplate.\nDisconnect the fill and drain hoses.\nUnthread any mounting screws keeping your dishwasher under your counter. Then pull it out, and unplug it from the wall outlet.\nTilt the dishwasher on its back just enough so you can access the heating element and fuse. The element will likely be at the rear and the fuse at the front.\nUnplug the wire harnesses connected to the heating element and fuse, then remove them carefully.\nTest the heating element using a multimeter in continuity mode, by touching each terminal with a probe. If there's no continuity in the heating element or fuse, replace one or both.\nInstall the heating element and fuse back into their respective housings in the dishwasher, and connect their wire harnesses.\nTilt the dishwasher back, slide it back into place, plug it in, and thread its mounting screws.\nConnect its fill and drain hoses, and turn the water valves back on.\nStart a cycle and monitor your dishwasher to see if the issue returns.\n\n\nHow to Replace an Inlet Valve to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nThe inlet valves electronically control the flow of water into your dishwasher during each cycle. When these valves fail, the dishwasher may not receive enough water, resulting in mid-cycle stops. If your dishwasher's inlet valves fail, you might notice water leaking from the bottom while it's running. We'll walk you through a step-by-step process to inspect, troubleshoot, and potentially replace the inlet valves, to get your dishwasher working without interruption.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\n\n\nPhilips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver\nSocket Wrench\nNeedle-Nose Pliers\nMultimeter\nTowels\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\n\nShut off the water supply to your dishwasher.\nUnplug your dishwasher from the wall outlet. If that's not possible, turn off the outlet at the breaker.\nUnthread and remove the dishwasher's kick plate.\nLocate the inlet valve underneath the dishwasher; it will normally appear as a blue, white, or clear plastic pipe with a wire and bracket attachment.\nRemove the wires from it, then place towels down before you disconnect the fill hose as well.\nInspect the inlet valves, and if no damage is present, use a multimeter to test its continuity.\nWith the multimeter in continuity mode, touch each probe to a terminal on the inlet valve. If the reading is between 500 to 1500 ohms, the valve has continuity. However, if there's no reading, it's weak, or if they're damaged, replace the inlet valves.\nInstall the inlet valve by securing it within the dishwasher bracket and installing its wires and fill hose.\nReinstall the kick plate and connect your dishwasher back to power.\nBegin a cycle and monitor your dishwasher to see if it stops mid-cycle again.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Pump to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nA clogged or malfunctioning dishwasher pump, whether due to mechanical or electrical failure, can cause your dishwasher to stop suddenly during a cycle. However, severe clogs caused by gunk or foreign objects can also lead to this issue. If your dishwasher's pump is clogged, a common sign you may notice is water left at the bottom after a cycle. If this is the case, cleaning or replacing the pump is necessary to get your dishwasher washing properly again.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\n\n\nPhilips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver\nSocket Wrench\nNeedle-Nose Pliers\nMultimeter\nBucket or Large Bowl\nBrush or Sponge\nDrain Brush\nSoap and Warm Water\nTowels\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\n\nShut off the dishwasher's water supply.\nTurn off the dishwasher's power by unplugging it or turning off its breaker.\nUnthread the dishwasher's kick plate and remove it.\nUnthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect the drain hose from your sink or garbage disposal.\nUnthread the dishwasher mounting screws under the countertop.\nCarefully pull the dishwasher out and tilt it on its back to access the pumps.\nLocate the pump under your dishwasher, and disconnect any wire connectors or hoses connected to it. Your dishwasher may have multiple pumps, which should all be inspected and cleaned, if necessary.\nRemove the pump and inspect it for any clogs by gunk or foreign objects.\nIf it's not clogged, use a multimeter set to continuity mode, to test the pump for continuity. The pump's terminals should give a reading between 15-40 ohms, and if they give a weak reading, the pump has failed and will need to be replaced.\nInstall the pump, and the necessary wire connectors and hoses.\nPush the dishwasher back into place, then thread the fill hose to the inlet valve, and install the drain hose underneath your sink.\nReplace the kick plate, plug in your dishwasher, and turn the water supply on. Run a cycle and see if the dishwasher stops mid-cycle.\n\n\nHow to Replace an Electronic Control Board to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle\nAs the brains of your dishwasher, the electronic control board oversees its various functions. As a result, a malfunctioning control board could be to blame for mid-cycle shutdowns or other system issues, like a short causing it to be unable to properly regulate functions like filling and draining. When this happens, it's important to replace your dishwasher's electronic control board, so it can resume smooth dishwashing without interruption.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\n\n\nPhilips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver\nSocket Wrench\nNeedle-Nose Pliers\nMultimeter\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\n\nMake sure the circuit breaker and water supply to your dishwasher are turned off.\nCheck your owner's manual for the exact location of the electronic control board. Some may be located underneath the appliance, behind the kick plate, whereas others may be located within the door panel, near the control panel.\nIf your model's control board is below the appliance, use a screwdriver to unthread and remove the kickplate to access it. If yours is in the door, unthread the screws around the perimeter of the door's inside frame and separate the two halves.\nOnce you have access to the control board, take note of the wire connectors attached to the control board, and disconnect them.\nTake the new electronic control board and plug in the necessary wire connectors to install it.\nReassemble your dishwasher door or kick plate, turn the circuit breaker back on, and run a test cycle to ensure the dishwasher works again.\n\n\nNow that your dishwasher is running again without interruption, you can get back to the convenience of clean dishes without having to hand-wash them!

Press the Reset Button on Your Samsung Fridge2.Press the Power Cool and Power Freeze buttons on Your Samsung Fridge3. Use the Family Hub App to Reset Your Samsung Fridge4. Turn Off the Circuit Breaker for your Samsung FridgeWhat to Do if Power Freeze Keeps Turning On By ItselfWhether you're restocking groceries or preparing for gatherings, Power Cool is a feature available on many Samsung refrigerators, designed to rapidly lower the temperature inside the fridge compartment. Power Cool is commonly used after grocery shopping, when preparing for gatherings, or during hot weather conditions. To activate Power Cool, you can use either the control panel on the refrigerator or the Family Hub app. Factors influencing the duration of Power Cool include initial temperature, amount and temperature of contents, room temperature, refrigerator age, frequency of door openings, and the size and model of the refrigerator. If Power Cool is not working, you can try resetting the refrigerator to restore it to its original settings. Ultimately, Samsung's Power Cool feature offers a convenient way to ensure your food stays cool and your groceries remain fresh for longer. Follow this guide to learn how to get the most out of this feature!\n\nWhat is Power Cool on a Samsung Refrigerator?\nPower Cool allows you to lower the temperature inside the refrigerator compartment quickly. When Power Cool is activated, the refrigerator begins to run the compressor at a higher capacity to help cool down the interior rapidly. This feature allows you to instantly chill the food items stored in the fridge compartment. \n\nWhat is Power Freeze on a Samsung Refrigerator?\nThe Power Freeze feature works similarly to the Power Cool feature by running the compressor at a higher capacity, but it is used for the freezer compartment. It is designed to rapidly freeze items and is usually activated when you need to quickly freeze fresh groceries or items such as ice cream. The Power Freeze function also shortens the amount of time needed to produce ice from the ice maker. It is best to activate Power Freeze one full day before you place items in the freezer. Once it is activated, Power Freeze will run for 50 hours before gradually returning to the normal freezer temperature. To activate and deactivate it, simply press and hold the Freezer button for 3 seconds or select the Power Freeze option in your Family Hub account.  \n\nHow Long Does Power Cool Stay On?\nIt generally takes approximately two hours for the fridge to fully cool after Power Cool is activated. Once the temperature reaches 1°C the Power Cool function switches off. After several hours the fridge will gradually return to its normal temperature.\n\nWhen to use Power Cool on a Samsung Refrigerator?\nPower Cool is a powerful and convenient way to cool the interior of the fridge. You can use Power Cool in the following scenarios to help get the most out of your appliance: \n \nAfter Grocery Shopping: You can use Power Cool to quickly chill newly purchased perishables, ensuring they remain fresh for longer periods. This is great for items such as fruits and vegetables which tend to go bad faster than other food items.\nPreparing for Gatherings: When you are expecting guests or hosting a party, you can activate Power Cool to rapidly chill beverages. This allows you and your guests to enjoy refreshments without any delay.\nEmergency Thawing: In the event of unexpected thawing or partially melted frozen items, such as due to a power outage or a fault in the fridge, you can activate the Power Cool to quickly restore the optimal temperature inside the fridge and preserve food quality. This means you can save money and avoid throwing out your food. \nHot Weather Conditions: During the hot summer months, the Power Cool feature is a great way to combat temperature fluctuations and maintain consistent cooling performance in order to protect your food from spoiling.\nPost-Cooking: After cooking a large meal, you can use Power Cool to quickly cool down leftovers before storing them in the refrigerator, preventing bacterial growth and maintaining food safety. Note that you should avoid placing very hot items in the fridge as hot items will release steam which condenses on the shelves and walls of the fridge. This creates a humid environment which can promote bacterial growth and increase food spoilage.\nRefrigerator Overload: When the refrigerator is overloaded with items, enabling Power Cool allows cold air to circulate through the fridge faster which ensures efficient cooling throughout the appliance. However, it is important to note that the fridge will need to use significant energy to run Power Cool when it is overloaded. \n\n\nHow to Use the Power Cool Feature on Your Samsung Fridge\n1. Use the Samsung Fridge Button\nLocate the \"Fridge\" button on the control panel of your refrigerator. Press and hold the button for 3 seconds and wait for the corresponding display to light up. This indicates that Power Cool is now running You can switch off the Power Cool function by pressing and holding the button again until the indicator light switches off.\n\n2. Use the Samsung Family Hub App\nFirst ensure that your Samsung refrigerator is connected to your home Wi-Fi network and that you have the SmartThings App installed on your phone or tablet. Log in to your account and connect the refrigerator to your Family Hub account. Navigate to the Fridge Manager button and click on it. Tap on the toggle labeled Power Cool to activate Power Cool in your fridge. Once Power Cool has been activated, you can monitor the temperature inside the refrigerator from your phone. You may also receive notifications or updates through the Family Hub app. \n\nFactors that Affect Duration of Power Cool\nThe duration of the Power Cool feature can be influenced by several factors:\n\nInitial Temperature: The starting temperature inside the refrigerator affects how long the Power Cool feature will need to run to reach 1°C. If the fridge is already low, Power Cool might not need to run for as long.\nAmount and Temperature of Contents: The more and warmer the items you've just placed in the fridge, the longer Power Cool may need to run to bring the overall temperature down. If you've just done a large grocery shopping trip and filled the fridge with items then, Power Cool will need more time to chill all the items.\nAverage Room Temperature: The temperature of the kitchen can impact how quickly the fridge can cool down. If the room temperature is warmer, the fridge will have to work harder to cool down. This is especially true in the summer months when average temperatures are higher.\n Refrigerator Age: As the refrigerator ages, parts such as the compressor, condenser coils, and seals may wear down, leading to reduced cooling efficiency and increased energy consumption. In such cases, the Power Cool feature will still work as intended, but it might take longer to achieve the desired temperature or require more energy to operate. If you have noticed that your fridge is not running efficiently, it may be due for some maintenance. \nFrequency of Door Openings: Opening the refrigerator door frequently during the Power Cool cycle allows warm air to enter the fridge compartment which can increase the amount of the refrigerator needs to cool down.\nSize of the Refrigerator: Larger refrigerators with more internal volume may require longer Power Cool cycles to reach the desired temperature compared to smaller models.\n\n\nWhat to Do When Power Cool in Your Samsung Fridge is Not Working\nIf the Power Cool feature is not working, it may be due to a minor system glitch in the refrigerator. It is common for users to run into technical problems every so often. You can fix this issue by resetting the refrigerator. This will clear out any old settings and restore the fridge to its default settings. You can follow any of the methods below to rest your Samsung fridge.\n\n1. Press the Reset Button on Your Samsung Fridge\nLocate the Reset button on the control panel on the refrigerator. Once you have found it, press and hold the button for 3 - 5 seconds. The control panel should light up as it resets. Once the display has returned to normal check that the fridge is running properly again. \n\n2.Press the Power Cool and Power Freeze buttons on Your Samsung Fridge\nIf your Samsung fridge does not have a Reset button, you can use the Power Cool and Power Freeze buttons to reset the fridge instead. Press and hold the buttons together, at the same time for 10 seconds. You should hear a chime as the refrigerator resets itself.\n\n3. Use the Family Hub App to Reset Your Samsung Fridge\nOpen the Family Hub App on your phone and click on the Settings button. Scroll down to the option that says \"About Family Hub\". Select the \"Factory data reset\" option and then press on the \"RESET\" option. The app will then prompt you to press \"RESET\" again. Finally, press \"Delete all data\". \n\n4. Turn Off the Circuit Breaker for your Samsung Fridge\nGo to the electrical panel in your home and find the switch that corresponds to the refrigerator. Flip the switch and leave it turned off for at least five minutes. This allows the electronic controls and components to reset completely. Turn the switch back on and allow the fridge to power on and stabilize. Verify that the refrigerator is functioning properly again after the hard reset.\n\nWhat to Do if Power Freeze Keeps Turning On By Itself\nA common problem that Samsung fridge users face is the Power Freeze function cycling on on its own. This typically indicates a stuck key or an internal fault within the display panel on the front of the refrigerator. You can browse our list of genuine OEM Samsung refrigerator parts to find a replacement for your model! To remove the display panel, first locate and unthread the mounting screws(s) located on the underside of the panel. Once you have done so you can grip the bottom of the panel with both hands and pull it out of the housing. Disconnect the wire connector and discard the old panel. Attach the wire connector to your new display panel and pop it back into the housing. Remember to rethread the mounting screw to hold it in place. \n\nSamsung's Power Cool feature is a powerful tool designed to rapidly cool down your refrigerator's interior, ensuring your groceries stay fresh for longer. By activating this feature strategically during periods of high usage or after loading in a large batch of warm items, you can maintain optimal temperature levels and preserve the quality of your stored food. Remember that while Power Cool is incredibly effective, using it excessively can lead to unnecessary energy consumption. So be sure to follow the guidelines set out above on when and how to use the Power Cool feature for maximum efficiency. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This is likely due to a blown fuse, which interrupts the power supply to protect the microwave from further issues. In this article we’ll walk you through the steps to test and replace a faulty fuse, along with helping you determine what could be causing this to happen. Replacing a microwave fuse is a simple DIY repair, so long as you pay attention to the important safety precautions. Let’s get your microwave back up and running again!\n\nWhat is a Microwave Fuse?\n\nThe fuses in your microwave are there to prevent damage to the appliance, by cutting off the electricity if either the current or temperature levels are too high. Your microwave will typically have two different types of fuses. The main fuse will be either glass or ceramic, and is used to protect the appliance against overcurrent. The second type is a thermal fuse, which protects against overheating. These fuses are typically one-time use, so once they have blown they will need to be replaced. This is considered a safety feature, as it prevents the microwave from being used when it could cause a fire or further damage to the appliance.\n\nWhen replacing this part, it’s important to ensure the new fuse is the same amperage as the old one. Checking your model number and purchasing genuine OEM microwave parts will guarantee that the fuse is the correct amperage for your microwave.\n\nSafety Warnings for Microwave Repairs\n\nMicrowaves contain a high-voltage capacitor, which can store a lethal amount of electricity. Before beginning any repair work on a microwave, it is crucial that you disconnect the power supply and discharge the capacitor to eliminate any risk of electrical shock. While capacitors will eventually lose charge after the microwave has been unplugged, there is no set “safe” amount of time to pass to guarantee they’re depleted. Manually discharging the capacitor is required to continue safely working on the microwave . If you are not comfortable with performing this task, or do not have the proper equipment, you should contact a repair professional as they will be equipped and trained in properly discharging the capacitor.\n\nHow to Discharge a Microwave Capacitor\n\nTo safely discharge a microwave capacitor, you will require some shock-proof equipment including rubber work gloves, and insulated screwdriver or pliers. You may also want a copy of the user manual and wiring diagram for your model, so you can easily find where the capacitor is located.\n\nBegin by disconnecting the power to your microwave. Unplugging it from the wall is best, but turning off the breaker also works.\n\nNext you will need to remove the microwave case. This step will vary depending on the make and model of the microwave, however you will likely need a screwdriver to remove the cabinet.\n\nLocate the capacitor in your microwave using your user manual for reference.\n\nThe capacitor should have two terminals, which you will connect with your tool of choice. It is vital that you are wearing rubber gloves and that the tool you use is insulated. If you are using a screwdriver, lay the metal across both terminals. If you are using pliers, open them and touch each tip to a terminal.\n\nLeave the tool across the terminals for a few seconds. When connected, the terminals will likely spark. while scary, it is normal as the capacitor discharges.\n\nRemove the tool from the terminals (only touching the insulated end) and you can safely carry on with the fuse testing and replacement.\n \n\nHow to Test a Microwave Fuse for Continuity\n\nIf your microwave has a glass fuse, you will be able to tell it’s blown just from a visible inspection. The inside of the tube will be black and burnt, similar to a lightbulb that’s burned out. A ceramic fuse however will need to be tested with a multimeter. Fuses can be found in various places within a microwave, so refer to your owner’s manual for the exact location. Typically you can follow along the power cord to find the fuse holder, but they may also be located along the top, side, or behind the vent grille.\n\nSet your multimeter to read for ohms of resistance. If your reader has the option, set it to give you an audible signal. It is a good idea to touch the probes together to hear the sound before testing the fuse itself.\n\nRemove the fuse from the holder and place it on a work surface.\n\nPlace one of the multimeter probes on each terminal of the fuse, and check the multimeter for the reading.\n\nIf it shows zero ohms of resistance (and makes the beeping tone, if applicable) the fuse has continuity and is still good.\n\nIf the needle on an analog reader doesn’t move, or the digital display shows anything besides 0, (or does not make a tone), then the fuse has blown and will need to be replaced.\n\n\nIf you don’t have access to a multimeter, you can also test a fuse on any touchscreen device. Hold one end of the fuse between your finger tips, and touch the other end to your cell phone or a tablet or laptop. If the fuse is good, the tip of it should respond on the touchscreen (see if you can type or open an app for example). If the fuse is bad, it usually won’t work on the touchscreen. Please note that while this is a somewhat effective alternative to multimeter testing if you don't own one or it is not functional, testing a fuse with a multimeter will always be the most reliable method.\n\nHow to Replace a Fuse in a Microwave\n\nIf you’ve determined that the fuse has blown, replacing it simply involves reversing the steps from above.\n\nTake your new fuse, and place it into the fuse holder ensuring it is snapped securely in place.\n\nReassemble the microwave and replace the outer cabinet.\n\nPlug the microwave back in, and place something inside the microwave (like a cup of water). Do not attempt testing the microwave by running it empty.\n\nIf the microwave runs and heats up the object, your repair was successful! \n\n\nWhy Does Your Microwave Keep Blowing Fuses?\n\nWhile a power surge can result in a blown fuses, if you are constantly replacing this part, it can indicate that there are further issues within the microwave. The following parts may be causing this to happen, and should be inspected, cleaned, or replaced if necessary.\n\nFaulty Microwave Door Switches\n\nDoor switches are another safety feature found on microwaves to prevent them from running while the door is open. If any of these switches are faulty, it can cause a short circuit which would result in a blown fuse. You can test them with a multimeter for continuity, and replace the door switches if necessary.\n\nClean Your Microwave Interior\n\nIf there is food splatters on the inside walls of your microwave, these could be burning and cause arcing while it is running.  Prevent this from being an issue by regularly wiping down your microwave and promptly cleaning up any spills or splatters.\n\nFaulty Microwave Capacitor or High Voltage Diode\n\nThese two parts are connected, and either could short circuit and blow the microwave fuse. A capacitor can be tested with a multimeter for continuity (follow the vital safety steps above to discharge the capacitor first). If the diode is faulty, your microwave may have made a loud noise before blowing the fuse. If either the capacitor or diode are faulty or completely failed, they’ll need to be replaced to keep your microwave running properly. \n\nWhile microwaves are a convenient source to quickly heat up your meals, they are an extremely powerful appliance and safety risks should be taken seriously. If your microwave is constantly blowing fuses, or shows any signs of sparking or overheating, do not continue to use it. If you are comfortable performing further repairs, we have the  microwave repair resources to walk you through the steps. Otherwise, your trusted repair expert is just a call away.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This ‘CL’ code is not an error, but a notification that the control lock is active, causing the control panel buttons and dial, except the power button, to be unresponsive to inputs or changes. The control lock is important because it prevents accidental washer use, especially by children. In this article, we'll explain how to activate and deactivate this lock for front and top-load washers and provide steps on how to reset your LG washer if you have difficulties deactivating the ‘CL’ code.\n\nIt is worth noting that LG washers, dryers, and dishwashers share the ‘CL’ code between them. This means the process of turning the control lock on or off works the same way, and the following guide can be used to resolve any issues with any of them. If you need to reset your LG washer, dryer, or dishwasher, you can also use the same set of instructions to do so.\n\nHow to Turn On and Turn Off an LG Washer Control Lock\nThere is no difference in the activation process for top-load and front-load LG washers, but instead, it depends on whether you have a single or double-button control lock model. In either case, we'll explain how to activate and deactivate the control lock, so you can get back to washing your clothes.\n\nTurn On and Turn Off an LG Washer Control Lock with a Single Button\nIf you own an LG washer with a single, designated control lock button, the activation and deactivation process is quite straightforward. If you're unsure whether your model is a single or double-button model, use your owner's manual to identify which you have.\n\n\nTo activate the control lock, locate the designated control lock button, and hold it for 3–5 seconds to turn it on. \nA chime should sound, and a 'CL' code will begin to flash on the display, as well as the remaining cycle time if a cycle was started. On some LG washer models, a small lock icon with a smiley face will appear. Note: If you turn the lock on during a wash cycle and fail to deactivate it before the cycle completes, the lock will remain on even after the washer turns off.\nTo turn off the control lock for your LG washer, hold the same button for 3–5 seconds. Another chime should sound, and the 'CL' code will disappear from the display.\n\n\nTurn On and Turn Off an LG Washer Control Lock with Two Buttons\nIf your LG washer has two ‘Control Lock’ labelled buttons side-by-side instead of one, use those to turn the lock on or off. If the buttons aren't labelled, or you're unsure which buttons to press, use your owner's manual to help you identify which buttons you need to use.\n\n\nTo activate the control lock on your washer, identify which two buttons are used to activate it.\nHold the two buttons you've identified for 3–5 seconds to activate and turn on the control lock. A chime should sound, and a  'CL' code should appear and begin flashing. For some models, a small lock icon with a smiley face will appear until the lock is turned off. Note: If you activate the lock during a wash cycle and you do not turn it off before the cycle ends, the lock will remain on even after it ends and the washer turns off.\nTo turn off the control lock, hold the same buttons used to turn on the lock for 3–5 seconds. A chime should sound, and the 'CL' code and any lock symbols will disappear.\n\n\nHow to Reset an LG Washer to Turn Off a Control Lock\nYou may encounter an issue where the control lock will not deactivate from your LG washer, even after you hold down the necessary button(s) for 3–5 seconds. If this happens, you will need to perform a reset of your LG washer, which we will explain exactly how to do.\n\n\nPerform a hard reset of your washer by unplugging its power cord from the wall outlet or turning off its breaker.\nAfter 5 minutes the washer should be fully reset, and you can reconnect its breaker or plug it back into the wall outlet. At this point, the 'CL' code should no longer appear, and you should be able to use the washer fully again.\n\n\nNow that you know how to activate and deactivate your LG washer's control lock, you can not only prevent any children from accessing your washer while it's on, but you can be rest assured that your washer fully works again!

Turn Off the Circuit Breaker for Your Frigidaire FridgeIs your Frigidaire fridge acting up, leaving you with lukewarm drinks and thawing food? Resetting your Frigidaire refrigerator can often work wonders, and help you tackle issues from temperature problems to control panel glitches. In this article, we'll show how to perform a soft reset and a hard reset of your Frigidaire fridge and help you understand when and why it might be necessary, such as after a power surge or when the fridge is displaying an error code. Whether you're facing a minor glitch or major malfunctions, a reset could be just the ticket to restore your appliance's cool confidence. \n\nWhen to Reset Your Frigidaire Fridge \n\nAfter a Power Surge: Power outages or electrical surges can sometimes disrupt the normal functioning of electronic appliances like refrigerators. Resetting the fridge can help restore it to normal operation after such events.\nError Code Displayed: If your fridge displays error codes indicating a malfunction, resetting it can clear these codes and potentially resolve the underlying issue.\nTemperature Issues: If your fridge is not cooling or freezing properly, resetting it can help recalibrate the temperature settings and resolve the issue.\nControl Panel Malfunction: Sometimes, the control panel on your fridge may freeze or malfunction, causing it to stop responding to commands. Resetting the fridge can often fix this problem.\n\n\nTwo Methods to Reset Your Frigidaire Fridge \n\n1. Use the Reset Button or Crush Button on Your Frigidaire Fridge\nFirst, check if your fridge has a Reset button on the control panel at the front of the fridge. Once you have located it, press and hold the button for 5 seconds. If there is no Reset button, press and hold the Crush button for 5 seconds instead. You may see lights flashing on the control panel flash or hear a beeping as the fridge returns to its default settings. Once the reset process is complete, monitor how your refrigerator is performing over the next few hours to ensure that it is functioning properly again. \n\n2. Turn Off the Circuit Breaker for Your Frigidaire Fridge\nIf using the Reset button or Crush button does not reset the refrigerator, you can perform a hard reset instead. Locate the circuit breaker in your home and look for the switch that corresponds to the refrigerator. Flip the switch to the off position and wait at least 5 minutes to allow the refrigerator to completely power down. Turn the switch back on and allow the fridge to recalibrate itself. You should hear the compressor and fans running, which indicates that power has been restored. Once the fridge is fully powered up you can check to see if it's functioning properly and if there are no longer any error codes or control panel issues.  \n\n Knowing when and how to reset your Frigidaire fridge can be a valuable skill for maintaining its optimal performance and extending its lifespan. Whether you're experiencing temperature fluctuations, malfunctioning displays, or other issues, a reset can often provide a simple solution. By following the steps outlined in this guide and understanding the common reasons why a reset may be necessary, you can ensure that your Frigidaire refrigerator continues to keep your food fresh and your kitchen running smoothly. However, if resetting does not resolve the issue, then your fridge may need repair. You can use our model search feature to find genuine OEM Frigidaire refrigerator parts for your appliance.  With proper care and maintenance, your Frigidaire fridge will continue to serve you well for years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This guide will navigate you through the three best cleaning methods for your oven racks, which include using soap and water, a spray cleaner, and a combination of baking soda and vinegar. These methods are proven and effective, but you can choose whichever is most convenient for you. We'll also address common questions about oven racks, to help you better understand this cleaning process, and to help you get your racks shiny again!\n\nWhy and How Often You Need to Clean Your Oven Racks\nOven racks are removable metal shelves installed within your oven that support food items, containers, and trays, so they have a supporting platform to cook and bake on. Your oven racks will eventually get covered with grime and grease, and either need to be cleaned, or replaced. Neglecting to clean your oven racks will result in food residue buildup that can increase a fire risk, and create hard-to-remove odors. That is why we recommend cleaning your oven racks with this guide at least once or twice a year, or more frequently, based on your oven usage. This will help maintain their condition, prevent replacement, and enhance your comfort.\n\nBest Ways to Clean Oven Racks\nCleaning your oven racks is easy and can be done quickly and effectively, whether they're only slightly grimy, or heavily greased. The best methods for cleaning oven racks are either in a bathtub or large container, or outside in a large plastic bag. These options minimize mess and hassle compared to using a sink, but a sink can also be used if a tub or outdoor cleaning option doesn't suit your set-up. Regardless of whichever cleaning process suits you better, we have the guides to assist you.\n\nHow to Clean Oven Racks in a Bathtub\nThe most common recommendation from experts is cleaning oven racks in the bathtub, as it allows for ample space and water to thoroughly clean them, without all the mess. But if you do not have access to a bathtub, a large container can serve as an effective alternative for cleaning your oven racks. We have a list of all the supplies you’ll need, along with instructions to explain how to make sure they're effectively cleaned.\n\nEverything You Need:\n\nBathtub or Large Container\nWarm Water\nDish Soap/Detergent or Dishwasher Tablet\nTowels\nNon-Abrasive Sponge or Brush\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\nIf you're using a bathtub, spread towels at the bottom of the tub to ensure it doesn't get scratched by the racks.\nPlace your oven racks inside the bathtub or large container.\nFill the bathtub or large container with warm water and pour dish soap/detergent or place a dishwasher tablet in the water.\nAgitate the water to ensure the soap or tablet dissolves properly.\nLeave the racks to sit in the soap and water for a few hours, or overnight if possible.\nOnce the racks have soaked for that extended period of time, drain the water from the tub or container.\nRinse the racks with warm, clean water, and scrub them with a sponge or brush.\n\n\nHow to Clean Oven Racks in Plastic Bags\nUsing a large plastic bag to clean your oven racks offers a convenient and efficient way to clean your oven racks. By using plastic bags and a spray aerosol cleaner, you save water, avoid a messy cleanup, and still get clean oven racks. The plastic bags are used to help seal the cleaner to the oven racks and ensure it stays wet for a longer period, which improves its cleaning power and prevents it from dripping off. We’ll provide you with a comprehensive list of the supplies you’ll need, and step-by-step instructions to make it as easy and hassle-free as possible.\n\nEverything You Need:\n\nTrash Bag(s)\nNon-Abrasive Sponge or Soft-Bristle Brush\nLatex/Rubber Gloves\nSpray/Aerosol Cleaning Product of Choice (Easy-Off, for example)\nClean Water\nDish Soap\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\nMake sure you are outside your home, and in a well-ventilated area.\nPut the oven racks in their own respective bag.\nSpray each rack liberally with a specialized oven cleaning product of your choice.\nEnsure each rack is completely covered, and then close the bags and allow them to sit for 30 minutes to an hour, flipping them over halfway through.\nAfter the hour is up, remove the oven racks and scrub them with a non-abrasive sponge or brush, and then wash the grease and gunk off with clean, soapy, warm water.\n\n\nHow to Use Baking Soda and Vinegar to Clean Oven Racks\nIf you want to clean your oven racks using all-natural ingredients and without the harsh chemicals and fumes of some spray cleaners, you can use the more natural solution of baking soda and vinegar to help break it down. Using a baking soda and vinegar combination together can act as a mild abrasive and acid, which makes cleaning tough grime and grease stains with a sponge or brush easier. Below, we'll detail everything you need, and all the required steps to get the rest of the mess off.\n\nEverything You Need:\n\nBathtub or Large Container\nBaking Soda\nVinegar\nBowl\nPaint Brush (or something similar)\nNon-Abrasive Sponge or Brush\nWarm Water\nSpray Bottle (Optional)\nTowels (Optional)\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide:\n\nIf you're using your bathtub, ensure you place towels down before you put your oven racks down.\nPlace your oven racks in a large container or bathtub.\nCreate a paste with equal parts baking soda and water (a half cup of each will work) in a bowl.\nUse a brush to coat the racks with the paste, and allow it to sit for 30-45 minutes.\nAfter that time, create a mixture of equal parts vinegar and water, and spray or slowly pour it over the racks.\nAllow the racks to sit for another 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, rinse the racks with clean water, and then scrub them with a soft brush or non-abrasive sponge and warm, soapy water.\nRinse the racks a final time, and allow them to dry.\n\n\nHow to Keep Your Oven Racks Clean\nNow that your oven racks are clean, it's about keeping them clean for the long term. To help you do that, we'll delve into three main strategies that are easy to follow and will help you maintain the cleanliness of your oven racks. These tips range from daily cooking practices, to tasks you can do a few times a year, all aimed at significantly improving your kitchen and home’s comfort.\n\nCook with Tin Foil or Baking Trays\nIt's important that whenever you're cooking or baking anything in your oven, you use a baking tray, baking sheet, or tin foil to avoid spillovers. These can also be used on the rack underneath your food container or tray, to prevent any drips or spills.\n\nClean Oven Rack Spills Immediately\nWhether it's a spill or residue build-ups in your oven, making sure to clean any food messes as they happen, will go a long way to keeping your oven racks, and oven in general, clean!\n\nRegular Light Cleaning\nRegularly cleaning your oven racks every few months will keep you from having to do any deep cleans. It truly does make a difference in your home, and keeps your oven from looking grimy and producing stubborn smells that linger.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions for Cleaning Your Oven Racks\nLearning how to effectively clean your oven racks may provoke some questions that other people have asked before, so we've put together this list of a few frequently asked questions to answer any that you may have.\n\nCan You Clean Oven Racks in the Dishwasher?\nWhile cleaning your oven racks in your dishwasher is completely possible, and some oven racks are designated as dishwasher-safe, we recommend you clean them manually. Washing oven racks in your dishwasher exposes them to high heat, and when combined with detergents, can cause discoloration of your racks. This is why we instead recommend cleaning them with household ingredients like dish soap and tablets, baking soda, vinegar, or spray cleaners.\n\nCan You Use Self-Cleaning to Clean Oven Racks?\nThe self-cleaning option within ovens is not recommended as a method to clean your oven racks. Continuously cleaning your oven racks with the self-clean option will lead to food spills, grease, and grime getting caked onto the racks, and even further discoloration and damage to the racks. Not to mention, this discoloration can lead to the rack's factory finish wearing off, and the racks becoming harder to slide in and out of your oven.\n\nCan You Clean Oven Racks with Dishwasher Tablets?\nYou can use dishwasher tablets as a soap alternative in the cleaning process of oven racks, but as mentioned above, cleaning your oven racks in a dishwasher isn't recommended. To clean with dishwasher tablets, follow the methods listed above, and make sure to agitate them so they fully dissolve in your large container or bathtub, before they soak for a few hours.\n\nDo Dryer Sheets Clean Oven Racks?\nDryer sheets do not clean oven racks, and their use in cleaning oven racks is entirely useless.\n\nHow to Clean Oven Racks Quickly\nThe quickest way to clean your ovens racks is with a baking soda paste and vinegar spray. In less than an hour and a half, you can have cleaned most, if not all, grime and food splatters on your oven racks, depending on how heavy the buildups are.\n\nWhen Should You Replace Your Oven Racks?\nKnowing when it's time to replace your oven racks can be harder than you'd think, but we've got all of the reasons you'd need to consider, if you're on the fence.\n\nOven Racks Can't Support Food Items: The main purpose of oven racks is to support your food items and containers, and if they are sagging and can't do that anymore, it's time to replace them.\nOven Racks Don't Fit Properly in Your Oven: Aside from being a pain to slide and out of your oven, an oven rack that's warped or bent, and not fitting properly anymore can also cause damage to your oven's inside walls.\nCan't Clean Oven Racks: If you've tried cleaning your oven racks before, and the grease and grime buildup simply will not come off, it's probably time to wipe the slate clean and replace them.\n\n\nAnd now that you have some beautiful, sparkling oven racks, and the knowledge to clean them again in the future, you can get back to cooking and baking, without the lingering smells and food splatters all over them!

A clogged washer drain will cause those things to happen, and finding the root cause of the clog is the most important aspect to clearing it. Effectively cleaning and unclogging your washer may require you to disassemble parts of your washer, like the drain filter, the drain hose, or in the drain pipe. You can follow this guide as we explain why the clog is happening, how to tell where it is, what tools and materials you need, and then how to effectively clear it!\n\nWhy is Your Washer Drain Backing Up?\nAny appliance with a drain pump can experience a clog of some sort. Washer drains, however, deal with many more variables in the form of items that you leave in your clothes pockets. Those small items can get caught in the drain of your washing machine's drain filter, drain hose, or drain pipe, and cause all of the dirt and debris from your clothes to buildup with excessive detergent and fabric softener and eventually cause a clog. Different washer models have different types of filters and filter locations, and because each home is different, your drain and its plumbing layout will also differ. But we will ensure you have the knowledge to find out what's causing your washer's clog and clear it!\n\nHow to Tell What in Your Washer is Clogged\nAs previously mentioned, finding the root cause of your washer's clog is the crucial piece of information you need to unclog it. There's no definitive way to understand whether your washer is experiencing a clog in one place and not another, but by inspecting its parts you can come to understand what is causing it. Note: If your washer displays any error codes, be sure to look them up in your washer's user manual, so you have a more clear understanding of what's going on in your machine, and to avoid bigger issues and further damage.\n\nHow to Tell if Your Washer's Coin Trap/Drain Filter is Clogged\n\nYour washer isn't fully draining, and there's standing water left after the cycle is finished.\nRattling noises coming from the location of the coin trap/drain filter.\nWasher drains slowly and overall cycle takes longer.\nClothes are extremely damp and smell musty when the cycle is over.\nSoap residue is left on clothes when they're removed after the cycle is finished.\n\n\nHow to Tell if Your Washer's Drain Hose is Clogged\n\nGurgling and bubbling noises coming from the hose and drain pipe.\nBad odors emanating from the drain.\nCycle ends with the tub filled with water and clothes are still wet.\nWater is leaking onto the floor near the washing machine.\n\n\nHow to Unclog Your Washer's Drain Filter\n\nThe drain filter is the first place you would visit to check and inspect for a clog, because it's designed to be accessed and cleaned easily. Inspecting your drain filter for excess lint, dirt, and gunk is essential to getting it clean, and unclogging your washer's drain.\n\nWhat is a Washer Filter and Where is it Located?\nEmptying your pockets out before putting your clothes in the washer is an important task, but sometimes items can get missed. Luckily, the filter in your washer, also known as a coin trap, is a device that is used to prevent small objects like coins or keys from entering the drain pump and damaging it. However, this filter can become severely clogged if not cleaned regularly. It's recommended to clean your washer's filter once every 3 months, or more if you average more than 1 wash a day.\n\nThe location of the filter in your washer will depend on the make and model of it, but there are are a few common locations to check on top-load and front-load washers. Newer model machines have easier to access filters, and in most cases they're easy to find. But if your washer doesn't have a filter in the following locations, we recommend using your washer's model number to find specific diagrams for it.\n\nCommon Filter Locations for Top-Load Washers:\n\nInside the agitator at the center of the washer drum.\nOlder models will likely have the filter underneath the agitator.\nAlong the top rim or wall of the drum.\n\n\nCommon Filter Locations for Front-Load Washers:\n\nAt the end of the drain hose.\nBehind the access panel at the lower front portion of the appliance.\n\n\nWhat You Need to Unclog a Washer's Drain Filter\n\nDistilled white vinegar or Bleach\nBoiling water\nDrain snake/auger\nScrewdriver\nBowl\nTowels\nMild soap\n\n\nHow to Remove and Clean a Front-Load Washer's Drain Filter\nA clog in your front-load washer's drain filter means it will begin to drain slower, leave standing water in the tub, and not fully wash your clothes.\n\n\nStart by pouring a half cup of bleach or distilled white vinegar in the dispenser drawer, and running a short cycle with warm water and no clothes in the washer. You can also use a store-bought cleaner.\nDuring the washing cycle, listen for abnormal noises or sounds, or anything out of the ordinary (i.e. rattling, water leaking, etc.).\nWhen the cycle ends, turn off the washer and disconnect it from the wall outlet.\nOpen the door and note any standing water.\nLocate the coin trap/drain filter. If your model doesn't have a filter in the front portion, skip to the Drain Hose section.\nPut a bowl and towel down underneath the opening to the filter.\nIf your model has a tube for excess gunk and lint, loosen and drain it into the bowl, and then close it.\nRotate and remove the drain filter with the bowl underneath, and then clean it with warm water and mild soap.\nBefore using your washer again, ensure the drain filter and tube are properly seated and secured.\n\n\nHow to Clean and Unclog a Top-Load Washer Drain Filter\nTop-load washing machines normally employ a filter that, like front-load washers, can become built-up with gunk and other debris. When this happens, you will notice longer cycle times and water left at the bottom of the washer's drum.\n\nStart by pouring a half cup of bleach, distilled white vinegar, or a store-bought cleaner in the dispenser. Run a short cleaning cycle with warm water and no clothes in the washer.\nWhen the cycle is over, open the washer's lid and note any standing water.\nInspect the top of the lid or drum wall for a filter. If none are there, locate the filter in the agitator.\nDepending on when your washer was made, you should simply be able to rotate and lift the filter out of the agitator to clean.\nHowever, if your model was made before 2001, you will want to rotate the agitator until a securing nut appears.\nTake a socket wrench to unthread the nut and remove it, then lift the agitator out. Below should be a filter which can be removed and cleaned.\nEnsure the filter is cleaned properly with mild soap and warm water before you reinstall it and use your washer again.\n\n\nHow to Unclog Your Washer’s Drain Hose\nA clogged washer drain hose can translate to water backing up into to the washer drum, foul odors, and water even leaking into your home. Ensuring it's cleaned and free of clogs will allow you to wash your clothes with assurance and ease.\n\nWhat You Need to Unclog a Washer's Drain Hose\n\nDistilled white vinegar\nBaking soda\nBoiling water\nDrain snake/auger\nScrewdriver\nBathtub or Bucket\nTowels\nFlashlight (if necessary)\nWrench (if necessary)\n\n\nSteps for Unclogging a Washer's Drain Hose\n\n\nTurn off and and disconnect the water lines and power to your washer.\nRemove the washer from the wall and pull it into an open space. Now, inspect the drain hose for any kinks or damage. If it's damaged, ensure you replace it with a new one.\nPlace towels around your washer, and then using a screwdriver and/or wrench and pliers, disconnect the drain hose from the washer. This may require you to access the drain hose in the same panel as the drain filter.\nWith the drain hose disconnected from your washer, ensure it's disconnected from your home as well and inspect it for any filters on either end. If it has a filter, remove it and clean it with warm water and soap.\nPut your drain hose in a bathtub or large bucket, and carefully pour 4-5 cups of boiling water into it.\nOnce the water has fully flushed, pour a half cup of basking soda into the hose and shake it slightly to ensure its fully coated inside.\nThen, pour 1 full cup of vinegar into the hose and wait until the mixture stops bubbling. This may take a few minutes.\nOnce again, rinse with 4-5 cups of boiling water.\nWith the hose's interiors loosed, insert a drain snake into the hose and crank the handle until the clog is found and removed. Retract the cable to dislodge to clog.\nReconnect the drain hose to your washer but do not yet connect it back within your home.\n\n\nHow to Unclog Your Washer's Drain Pipe\nThe drain pipe in your home is essential to the waste water management of your washer and other appliances. But drain pipes can get clogged on their own, and when that occurs your washer will experience draining issues and water will get backed up into it.\n\nWhat You Need to Unclog a Washer's Drain Pipe\n\nDistilled white vinegar\nBaking soda\nBoiling water\nDrain snake/auger\nFlashlight (if necessary)\n\n\nSteps for Unclogging a Washer's Drain Pipe\n\n\nWith the drain hose removed, inspect your home's drain pipe and plumbing. Use a flashlight if necessary.\nIf any gurgling or bubbling noises occurred during the draining process of your washer from the drain pipe, there is a chance it's clogged.\nIf you suspect there's a clog in it, you can follow the same process as before and pour warm water, baking soda, and vinegar into it before dislodging any clogs with a drain snake.\n\n\nOnce you've inspected your drain pipe, hose, and filter, you can reconnect your washer's drain hose, water lines, and power, to reassemble your washer. After it's all together and turned on, run a quick test cycle and see if any of the previous symptoms you were experiencing return. If they do, you likely have to replace the drain pump itself or contact a repair technician to diagnose your washer.\n\nHow to Prevent Clogs in Your Washer’s Drain\nIt's impossible to guarantee that you washer won't get clogged again, but there are ways you can maintain your washing machine to avoid experiencing another clog.\n\nClean Your Filter: Every 6 months, or depending on how often you run your washer, you will need to clean the filter. This means removing it and inspecting your washer overall for gunk and dirt.\nInspect the Drain Hose: For many people, the drain hose can get kinked when the washer is pushed into place in your laundry room. Make sure before every wash that the drain hose isn't pushed and kinked into a small area, and has room to allow the waste water to exit.\nWasher Issues: Along with making sure your washer can drain properly, take note of any issues your washer has and address them then and there. Leaving your washing machine with problems for longer and create larger and more complex situations that your future self will have to deal with, and likely pay more to fix.\n\n\nAnd now that your washer is clog free, your clothes and home will thank you! Now that you know how to keep your washer clog-free, you understand why it's so important and you get to enjoy the benefits of a fully operational washing machine.

We'll explain what could be going on within your refrigerator or the outlet it's plugged into, and we'll explain exactly how to identify which problem you're dealing with. This troubleshooting guide will take your through all of the possible problems and issues, and will ultimately help you get your refrigerator running again.\n\nWhat You Need to Know about Electrical Circuits\nThe first step in understanding the why your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is having a solid understanding of each of the affected components that we'll be talking about in this guide. The following is a glossary of parts and terms to provide you with the knowledge you need to get to work.\n\n\nCircuit: A closed path that allows electricity to flow from one point to another.\nCircuit Breaker: A safety device designed to interrupt and protect an electrical circuit within equipment and prevent the risk of fire. The breakers within a circuit can be reset to continue the flow of electricity.\nFuse: A closed path device that allows electricity to flow between two points, but will break and need replacing after one surge or trip.\nFuse Box/Breaker Panel/Junction Box: A electrical panel that contains either fuses or circuit breakers for a building. They are designed to provide protection to individual power circuits from being overloaded or shorting to the ground.\nWire Harness: An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power.\nWall Outlet: An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.\nMultimeter: An instrument for measuring electrical properties, like voltage, resistance, and current.\nCircuit Tripping: When a circuit breaker detects an electrical issue, like an overload or short, and interrupts the flow of electricity to protect the circuit.\nGFCI Outlet: Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets are an advanced safety device made to monitor and protect a circuit from water or dampness.\nAFCI Outlet: Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) outlets are electrical devices designed to protect a circuit from electrical fires that stem from arcing faults (discharge of electricity between two conductors).\n\n\nWhy is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker?\nThe simplest and most common reason a refrigerator, or any appliance, would trip a circuit breaker or fuse box is because it's overloading the overall circuit. Overloading a circuit or fuse means that one appliance or device is drawing too much power it at one given time, compared to the rated capacity of the circuit or fuse. Normally when wiring homes, refrigerators are put on their own designated outlet due to the amount of power they pull, in an effort to curb this from happening. Manufacturers even state that a refrigerator must be on its own independent household circuit, so no other appliance or electrical device should be on the same circuit.\n\nBut there are other reasons why a circuit trips, such as faulty wiring from the outlet itself or the refrigerator connected to it, or if an older model refrigerator simply loses its power efficiency over time.\n\nHow To Find Out if Your Refrigerator is Tripping the Breaker\nWhen starting a repair journey like this, it's important to exercise caution whenever dealing with parts in and outside of your refrigerator, especially anything that has an electric current. Remembering to use proper protective equipment, such as insulated work gloves or safety glasses, is important to your safety and wellbeing, and to the overall result of the repair.\n\nInspect the Wall Outlet\nThe first place to inspect if you suspect your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is the wall outlet. To do this, you will need a voltage tester/multimeter that can display the output of the power at the outlet itself. That way you can find out if the outlet is outputting the proper voltage for the fridge and any other appliances that may be connected.\n\nWhen doing this, you should start by looking for visual indications of a problem, specifically signs of arcing or burning around the outlet, because those are clear indications of an issue with the outlet and the power cord of your refrigerator. A worn or defective outlet can cause electricity to arc and potentially burn the outlet, and if there are any damaged or exposed wires on the power cord, the outlet can cause issues with it, too. The power cord for your refrigerator can be replaced if it is found to be the cause of the refrigerators issue.\n\nWall outlets are designed to grip the prongs of the cord, and if the prongs are worn or damaged, that grip is lost. If the connection is loose, eventually it will melt the cord and any other plastic (i.e. the outlet cover) in the process. If the connection is poor enough between the prongs and the outlet, electricity will jump the gap and create a spark or arc, which burns even more and accelerates the failure. Test the voltage coming out of the outlet with a voltage tester to ensure you have the proper level between 110-120V. A low voltage will make starting the motor more difficult and could trop a breaker or fuse.\n\nIf the power cord is severely damaged and wires are exposed, it'll need to be replaced as soon as possible with an OEM cord. To do this, you will need work gloves, and a set of pliers. All you need to do is unplug your fridge and pull it out from the wall until you can access it, then unscrew any cover on the rear of the appliance. Follow the cord to where it connects and remove the clamp securing it. Connect the new one and reinstall the clamp, as well as the rear cover of the fridge, before you plug it back in.\n\nTroubleshoot Power Issues With Your Refrigerator\nIf you don't see any issues with your outlet or the surrounding area, it's time to test your refrigerator to see whether the tripping problem is being caused by the appliance. We recommend  testing the defrost timer and run capacitor in your refrigerator as your next steps, because it they are more likely to be causing the problem, than the breaker or fuse in your home. It makes sense to test and rule these out before exploring more serious electrical inspections. To troubleshoot your refrigerator, you will need a clamp multimeter and a line splitting tool to test the current within its power cord.\n\n\nFirst, you will want to move your refrigerator to a different outlet. This can be an outlet nearby,  just as long as your refrigerator is on a different circuit. However, you can also plug your fridge into an extension cord instead of moving it, but the cord needs to be properly rated for 15 or 20A.\nEnsure your refrigerator is plugged in directly to the line splitting tool and turned on.\nPlug the line splitting tool into your home's outlet and set your clamp on multimeter, capable of reading household currents, up with the refrigerator's power cord. A line splitting tool is a device that separates hot from neutral and ground wires, so you can measure the current being drawn.\nSet all temperature settings in the fridge to their lowest (coldest); this is to ensure it does not turn off during testing.\nUsing the clamp multimeter, check the current (amperage) being used by the fridge.\nIf the current being used by the fridge exceeds 15A, the electrical problem lies within the refrigerator.\nIf the current is less than 15A, put your refrigerator into defrosting mode. Models with timers can be advanced to initiate a defrost, whereas electronic control boards will require a specific set of steps to initiate a defrost cycle for testing. Since these steps can vary by make and manufacturer, you will need to find this information in your owner's manual or online.\nCheck the current reading again with your multimeter and if it exceeds 15A, the problem is with the fridge.\nIf after you've tested the fridge, the current does not exceed 15A, the circuitry issue is with your home. This could be an issue with a weak break, or a worn fuse holder, if your home has screw-in fuses.\n\n\nHow to Fix a Refrigerator that Keeps Shorting\nFor a refrigerator that's pulling too much power from the wall outlet and overloading the circuit, you will need to troubleshoot and potentially replace one of two parts in your fridge; the compressor's run capacitor, or the defrost timer or control board (depending on your fridge model). If your fridge model is from before 2000 you will likely have a defrost timer, if your model is from 2000-2015 you could have either, and if your fridge was made in the last 10 years (2015 onwards), it likely has a defrost unit within the control board. As we explain below, these parts are essential to the overall function of the refrigerator, and when they fail they can cause the trip you are experiencing. We walk you through how to identify which of these parts is causing the problem in your refrigerator, and we explain how to replace them to get your appliance running!\n\nHow to Replace a Refrigerator's Defrost Timer or Heater\nThe defrost timer and control board and heater are, as their name implies, responsible for the cooling and defrosting process of the refrigerator, which are determined either by a length of time, continuous or while the compressor runs, or by the number of times the doors are opened. They're also two of the most common reasons for a fridge to experience a short or interrupted circuit, due to the heater or timer/control board failing and pulling too much power, and overloading and tripping the outlet. Continue reading to find out how to replace or test your defrost timer or heater!\n\n\nUnplug your refrigerator from its wall outlet.\nOpen your freezer compartment and locate the heater. It's usually behind the back panel of the freezer section.\nAnything in the way will need to be removed, like the food items and contents of your freezer, and parts like the ice maker, and then finally the cover panel. This will all depend on your model and the features it includes.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread any securing screws or clips, and then remove the cover.\nUse a set of pliers to disconnect the wires for the heater.\nUsing a multimeter, set it to RX1 and place a lead on each of the terminals. If the reading is zero or infinity, replace it. If not, reinstall it and test your defrost timer instead.\nIf your defrost heater was the issue, remove the old one and replace it with the new one, and then carefully reassemble your freezer compartment.\nThen plug your fridge back in and monitor it.\n\n\n\nIf the defrost heater is not the issue, you will need to inspect and potentially replace the defrost timer or control board, depending on your refrigerator model. If your model has a control board instead of a timer, you will need to test the relay board. A relay board will either be built into the back of the fridge (and can only be accessed by pulling the fridge out from the wall) or will be in the same place as the control board.\n\n\nTo find the timer or control board in your fridge you will need to locate the control panel, since these parts are attached to the control panel. Depending on the model, it'll be in a number of places. The most common location for control panels would be in the back of the appliance near the top, or on the ceiling of the fridge compartment, behind the kick plate at the bottom of your fridge, or down by the compressor at the rear of the fridge.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread the control panel and open it.\nDisconnect the wire harness of the control panel to the fridge.\nUse a screwdriver to disconnect the defrost timer and heater from its assembly.\nWhether you have a timer or control board, testing it for continuity is the same. Using a multimeter, set it to the X1 setting for Ohm's and connect a probe to each terminal. If there is no continuity, replace the timer immediately.\nInstall the new timer and any wires connected to it.\nConnect the control panel's wire harness to the fridge and rethread the securing screws.\nPlug your fridge back in and monitor it.\n\n\nNote: To ensure that your relay or control board is bad/faulty, have them diagnosed by a qualified technician before purchasing a new one to replace it.\n\nHow to Replace a Refrigerator Compressor's Capacitor\nA fridge compressor's capacitor, also known as a relay, is what assists in turning the compressor on and off, depending on the cooling needed. But if the capacitor fails from old age or an electrical surge, it will no longer operate properly and it will overload its outlet, which leads to a short and tripped circuit. If you listen carefully, a failed capacitor will cause the compressor to click when it overloads the circuit. The capacitor will be located at the bottom rear portion of the refrigerator, and can be tested and replaced easily with a set of pliers, screwdriver, wrench, multimeter, and work gloves. Read along and we'll explain exactly how to fix your compressor.\n\n\nUnplug your refrigerator from the wall outlet.\nPull your fridge out from the wall, and remove its back panel with a screwdriver or wrench.\nLocate the capacitor and discharge any potentially stored electricity from it. This can be done by putting a metal object, like a screwdriver, across the two terminals of the capacitor.\nRemove any harnesses connected to it with a set of pliers.\nCarefully remove the old capacitor.\nUse a multimeter in Ohms mode to test it for continuity by touching the probes to the terminals. Ideally the resistance will rise and then fall back to zero, but if it rises and stays, the capacitor is shorted. If it does not rise at all, it is open and needs to be replaced.\nTo replace it, simply install the new capacitor in the old one's place, and reinstall the wiring harnesses by plugging them onto the capacitor.\nReplace the back panel of the fridge, and plug it back in. Let it run for a few minutes and take note of anything that happens.\n\n\nWhy Your Outlet Keeps Tripping\nNow that we have ruled out the refrigerator and the outlet it's plugged into, there are a couple more complex issues that could be causing the power to continually trip. We'll walk you through each of those reasons, and what your next steps should be.\n\nImproperly Routed Wire Harness\nElectrical wiring can be complicated, especially for an appliance like a refrigerator. This becomes even more of a nuisance when the problem with an appliance like a refrigerator lies within its wire harnesses. Even though it's a rarity, an incorrectly or improperly routed wire that comes into contact with another wire, can cause one or both to melt and cause a short within the refrigerator's circuit as a result. And in some cases, rodents will find their way into the compressor compartment and chew on the wires, creating a possibility of shorting or overheating. The only way you'd be able to find this issue, however, is by visually inspecting your refrigerator's wires and ensuring such a short does not exist. If you're not comfortable investigating your fridge's circuitry, consider contacting a repair technician to investigate your refrigerator for a short or other issue with its circuitry.\n\nIssues with GFCI Outlets\nDepending on how recently your home was built, a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet in your home may be tripping from a grounding issue. A grounding issue, or 'fault', happens when the electrical current from your home follows an unintended path to the ground (i.e. damaged wiring, moisture infiltration, etc.). It's worth noting though, that GFCI outlets are not commonly used for circuits with a fridge because they need to be accessible, so you can quickly and easily access them if they trip. This outlet can be replaced with an AFCI outlet, however, it's important to get a qualified electrician's opinion on your home's electrical layout before doing anything yourself.\n\nWhat to Do if Your Outlet Keeps Tripping\nIf you've inspected your fridge's wiring and your GFCI outlet has no indications of any damage or issue and is still tripping, there are a couple of ways to circumvent your outlet tripping and to get your fridge back and operational again, without needing any tools.\n\nSwitch the Refrigerator Outlet\nOne proven way to identify any electrical issues you're having with a refrigerator, or any appliance, is to switch its outlet. Whether it's some electrical interference, or if the outlet itself just isn't grabbing and supporting the refrigerator's power cord for any number of reasons, switching the outlet it's plugged into can allow your refrigerator to run, and pinpoint the problem to the outlet itself.\n\nUse an Extension Cord\nAdding on to the idea of switching outlets, if you need an extension cord to reach a different outlet, use one! But make sure of the extension cord's current rating. The cord will need to have a rating for 15 or 20A to handle the electric current from the wall outlet to the refrigerator without issue. If you've been using an extension cord for your refrigerator and it's not rated to handle 15 or 20A, replace it with one that can immediately. Using an extension cord with too low of an amperage compared to the amperage necessary for the appliance will cause an overload, and lead to the outlet tripping and potentially causing a fire.\n\nNow that your refrigerator is fully back and operational, hopefully you can get back to being able to properly store your food and keep it fresh for longer, without the worry of your fridge turning off or circuit tripping.

The 'IE' code stands for 'Inlet Error' and simply means the washer isn't receiving enough water to start the washing cycle. This is often caused by simple and straightforward fixes like the hose getting pinched, or the water outlet valves not being fully open, but may also require a quick part replacement. In either case, we have the guide here to explain how to figure out what is causing the 'IE' code to appear, and how to get it back to filling up with water and washing your clothes normally again!\n\nWhat Does the LG Washer Code ‘IE’ Mean?\nWhen your washer flashes an 'IE' code, it means 'Inlet Error', or at the very least that the control board interprets it that way. This inlet error essentially just means that the washer isn't detecting enough water in its tub, and depending on your specific model of LG washer, this can be not enough water at all, or just within the first 6 minutes of the washing cycle. If the washer's system doesn't detect enough water, it stops operation and flashes the 'IE' to notify you. An 'IE' error code also carries the same meaning if you have an LG dishwasher, as both dishwashers and washing machines access your water supply in a similar way. The following reasons are the most common reasons for this issue and for the 'IE' code to appear, and they're also the easiest to fix.\n\nWhat are the Common Causes of an LG Washer 'IE' Code?\nThe 'IE' code that pops-up on your LG washer is a way to notify you that there is an issue with the level of water that's currently flowing into the appliance. A few common and easy to fix issues that can impact water pressure are a water supply issue, clogged inlet valves, kinks in the fill hose, or a problem with the drain hose. We'll explain the entire troubleshooting process, with how to rule out each of these causes, and then how to identify and fix the problem. This simple process will ensure that water will be flowing into your washer in no time!\n\nHow to Fix the Common Causes of an LG Washer 'IE' Code\nAs mentioned above, the following are the most common causes for an 'IE' code to appear on your LG washing machine. These causes can be fixed with minimal DIY repair time or tools, or no tools at all!\n\nHow to Check the Water Pressure for Your LG Washer to Fix an ‘IE’ Code\nTackling the issue head-on and checking the water pressure going into your LG washer can quickly fix the filling issue you're having. All you need for this fix is a bucket and a set of pliers (if you have difficulty with the fill hose).\n\n\nFirst, check the water pressure gauge if your home has one. If the pressure reading is low, make sure to fully open the outlet valves/faucets. An ideal reading should be between 14.5 to 80 psi, and a rating over 116 psi would be considered too high.\nIf your home doesn't have a pressure gauge, turn off your washer by unplugging it from the wall outlet.\nClose and turn off the water outlet valves.\nPull your washer out so you can access the inlet valves, and then unthread and remove the water fill hoses from the washer and put them in a bucket. Use a set of pliers if unthreading the fill hoses is too difficult by hand.\nWith the fill hoses now in the bucket, open the water outlet valves and note how much pressure the water has. If the water pressure filling the bucket is weak, you likely have an issue with your home's water supply. If the water pressure is strong, turn the outlets off, reassemble your washer and its fill hose, and continue to follow this troubleshooting guide.\n\n\nHow to Clean an LG Washer Water Inlet Valve to Fix an ‘IE’ Code\nOne of the most common reasons an LG washing machine — or any washing machine — has issues with filling, is its inlet valve. This is especially true if your LG washer is flashing an 'IE' code, indicating a direct error with the filling ability of the inlet valve. We'll explain exactly how to access them, and get them clean. If you have difficulty with small objects, a set of needle-nose pliers may be necessary.\n\n\nUnplug your washer from the wall outlet and turn off the water outlet valves.\nPull your washer into an open space, enough for you to be able to access its backside.\nUnthread and disconnect the fill hose from your washer. Use a set of pliers if this is difficult for you.\nWith the fill hose removed, take out the filters inside the inlet valve by hand or with a set of needle-nose pliers. If your model has two inlet valves, do this for each. If your fill hose has a filter as well, ensure it's removed and cleaned, if necessary.\nWash the filter under warm water to remove any dirt and debris, and remove any gunk or foreign objects within the valve itself.\nOnce the filter is cleaned, reinstall it and reconnect the fill hose to the inlet valve. If your model has two inlet valves, ensure the cold and warm water hoses are connected to their correct valves.\nPlug your washer back in to the wall outlet and turn on the water outlet valves. Run a short cycle and see if the 'IE' code returns.\n\n\nHow to Inspect the Fill Hose to Fix an LG Washer ‘IE’ Code\nAnother common cause for the 'IE' code to pop-up on LG washers is a problem directly with the fill hose. Even though they're usually made of a durable plastic or rubber material, they can have issues that lead to weak water pressure entering your washing machine.\n\n\nCheck for Pinches: When moving appliances around, like our washing machines, we can forget to make sure that parts like the fill hose are free of blockages. Quickly check your fill hose to make sure that there's no pinches, kinks, or restrictive bends in the hose that would cause water to flow poorly.\nFill Hose is Frozen: Although not as common, the parts that directly carry water for your washing machine can freeze during the colder months of the year; parts like the fill hose, water pipe, or the water supply in general, are affected by it. Using a warm cloth, you can thaw the fill hose. If you notice any breaks or damage in the fill hose, replace it immediately.\n\n\nHow to Inspect an LG Washer Drain Pipe to Fix an ‘IE’ Code\nAnother common cause for LG washers to present an 'IE' code, is the drain hose being installed too deep into its drain pipe. This is especially common for LG washing machine owners who have a standpipe as their washer's drain, as an installation that's too deep will create a siphoning action and cause water to drain prematurely from the washer tub.\n\n\nUnplug your washer from the wall outlet and pull it out so you can access the drain hose and pipe.\nPull the drain hose out of the drain pipe, and using a measuring tape, ensure that the drain hose is installed less than 4 inches into the pipe.\nIf the drain hose is further than 4 inches into the pipe, adjust the bracket for the drain hose or the hose itself, so that it rests with less than 4 inches fully inside the pipe.\nReconnect your washer to the wall outlet and attempt a few washing cycles to see if the issue is resolved.\n\n\nHow to Replace an LG Washer’s Pressure Switch to Fix an ‘IE’ Code\nThe pressure switch in any washing machine that features one, is designed to detect the overall water level inside the washer tub, and control the inlet valve to allow water in. Some users may have an issue where their LG washer's pressure switch hose can disconnect or dislodge, and cause false positives for an inlet error. These users would then see the 'IE' code appear, despite no other issues or indications. Which is why we're going to explain exactly how to find your LG washer's pressure switch, and troubleshoot it. To do this, you will need a flat-head or Phillips-head screwdriver, a socket wrench, and a multimeter.\n\n\nFirst, make sure to unplug your LG washer, turn off its water outlet valves, and pull it out from any walls so you can access its interior.\nUse a screwdriver or socket wrench to remove the securing nuts or screws on the rear of your washer.\nFor front-load models, pull back on the top cover panel and remove it. If your washer is a top-load model, you will likely only need to remove the rear panel of the washer to access the switch.\nOnce you have access to the switch, disconnect its wire harness.\nRotate the switch and pull it out of the washer, and then examine the hose connected to it. Ensure there are no cracks or holes in it; if there are, it will need replacing.\nConnect the hose to the switch until it's snug.\nRefer to your washer's user manual for the pressure switch, to identify which terminals are used for what.\nThen, set your multimeter to the ohms setting, and touch the black probe to the common terminal and the red to the closed terminal.\nIf the multimeter displays close to \"0\", your switch has continuity. If not, it's likely faulty or bad and causing the 'IE' error code, and will need replacing.\nFor further confirmation, hold the opposite end of the pressure tube and blow into it. The display reading should indicate no continuity, and you should hear a clicking sound.\nReassemble your washer's panels, plug it back in, and turn the water on to see if the 'IE' code reappears.\n\n\nHow to Replace an LG Washer’s Control Board to Fix the ‘IE’ Code\nIf all else fails to resolve the 'IE' code for your LG washer, the control board is likely the cause of the issue. Whenever problems strike your appliances, the control board is almost always the very last issue you'd inspect or replace, considering it's normally the brains of the appliance and not as prone to failure. Depending on if your model is a top-load or front-load machine, these instructions will vary in how applicable they are to your specific washer. To do this repair, ensure you have tools like a screwdriver, socket wrench, and needle-nose pliers ready.\n\n\nUnplug your washer's power cable from the wall outlet, turn off and disconnect the water valve and hose, and pull your washer out so you can access it.\nUnthread and remove the top or rear panel of your washer.\nLocate your control board, either at the front, side, or back of the washer cabinet.\nUse a flat-head screwdriver or other flat tool to remove any securing tabs or screws for the control board's cover.\nDisconnect the wire harnesses for the control board. Use a set of pliers if necessary.\nUnthread and disconnect the control board, and remove it.\nInstall the new control board and secure it.\nConnect the necessary wire harnesses, and secure its cover if it has one.\nReplace the top or rear panel, and then plug your washer back in. Reconnect its water hose and turn the outlet valve on as well.\nTurn your washer back on, and run a short cycle to see if the 'IE' code is resolved.\n\n\nHopefully at this point, you're confidently using your LG washer again, with no issue and 0 indications of any 'IE' codes reappearing.

Front and top-load washer models differ in locking systems, and the parts you will need to fix will differ as well. Top-load washers won’t lock because of issues with their lid, lid switch and actuator, lid lock, or control board. Whereas front-load models may have problems with the door latch/strike, door seal, door hinge, or control board. We’ll guide you step-by-step to resolve this issue and get your washer locking and working again.\n\nWhy is Your Whirlpool Washer Not Locking?\nIf your Whirlpool washer isn't locking properly, there may be a few reasons why. If any of the parts in your washer's locking mechanism are broken or worn out, it can cause the whole lock to not line up correctly or work at all. Below we will explain why your washer needs to lock in the first place, the signs your washer has a locking issue, and the distinct differences between top-load and front-load Whirlpool washer lock parts.\n\nWhy Your Washer Needs to Lock\nThe entire reason your washer needs to lock is for safety reasons. The inner tub of your washer, whether it's a top-load or front-load model will, at some point during the washing cycle, begin to spin at RPM's (rotations per minute) that can be hazardous if insecure. Your washer is equipped with a locking mechanism to ensure you can't have any contact with it during these points. Some models outright lock the washer until the cycle is over, whereas some models will allow you to pause or stop the cycle to throw another garment in. But the lock is there as a preventative measure to ensure you or any children don't get injured.\n\nSigns That Your Whirlpool Washer has a Locking Issue\nIf you're unsure of what's going on with your Whirlpool washer, and you're curious if what you're seeing or hearing is a locking issue, these are the following signs.\n\n\nClicking Noises: If you hear a repeated clicking noise when starting a washing cycle with your Whirlpool washer, that is the sound of the lock attempting to connect and being unable to do so. Avoid hitting your washer to fix this, as you may cause more damage to it.\nFlashing Lock Light: Seeing a blinking or flashing 'lock' light on your Whirlpool washer is a sign that there is an issue with the locking system as a whole. The user manual for some models may indicate particular parts or give an error code with a specific issue. Make sure to reference your manual for those codes.\nWasher Not Starting: Another common sign is that your washer simply won't start. As mentioned earlier, your washer will not start if it cannot lock securely.\n\n\nDifferences Between Top-Load and Front-Load Washer Locks\nSince front-load and top-load Whirlpool washers have distinctly different structures, they also feature different parts in their locking mechanisms. There may also be differences in older versus newer models, so be sure to check your specific model and its user manual for any indication of what lock yours has.\n\nTop-Load Washer Lock Parts\n\nLid\nLid Switch and Actuator\nLid Lock\nControl Board\n\n\nFront-Load Washer Lock Parts\n\nDoor Latch/Strike\nDoor Switch\nDoor Seal (also known as a Boot) and Retaining Ring\nDoor Hinge\nControl Board\n\n\nHow to Fix a Top-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nNow that you know why your Whirlpool washer needs to lock, the signs that your washer has a locking issue, and all of the parts that can cause this issue, you can fix it! With a top-load Whirlpool washer, all of the affected parts that can malfunction and cause a lock-related issue are located at the top and rear of the washer, and will need minimal tools (screwdriver, wrench, and pliers) to access and replace!\n\nHow to Replace a Lid Switch to Fix a Top-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nThe lid switch and actuator for a top-load Whirlpool washer are responsible for communicating that the lid is closed, with the control board. If either are broken or malfunctioning, the control board will not start or lock properly as a result. Removing a lid switch to test and/or replace is easy, and with our instructions you will have no issue getting your washer running again. To do this repair, you will need a multimeter, screwdriver or wrench, and flat tool like a putty knife.\n\n\nUnplug your washer's power cord.\nLift the lid of the washer and unthread any mounting screws on the top panel around the entrance of the washer.\nIf you notice any unusual bends or warps in your washer's lid that could cause misalignment between the switch and actuator, replace it immediately.\nSlide the top panel forward and use a putty knife or flat tool to lift the top panel of your washer.\nLocate the lid switch on the underside of the top panel, and disconnect its wire harness to effectively remove it. Locate the actuator as well, which is normally on the underside of the lid.\nTest the old switch to verify that it's not physically damaged. Then test it with a multimeter for continuity by setting it to the Rx1 setting, and touching the probes to the terminals with the switch button down; you should receive a setting of zero.\nIf your switch is physically damaged or not reading 0 when activated, make sure to replace it immediately. If the actuator for the switch is also damaged and unable to fully activate the switch, replace it by unthreading its screws.\nPlug in the new switch via its wire harness and secure it below the washer's top panel.\nClose your washer and make sure the actuator fully sits within the switch before you plug the washer back in and attempt to run a cycle.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Lid Lock to Fix a Top-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nSome models of top-load washers feature a lid lock, that is similar in function and appearance to a lid switch, however, its sole purpose is securing the lid during the washing cycle. If the lid lock for your top-load Whirlpool washer is damaged or not locking properly, you will need to replace it immediately. To do this repair, you will need a screwdriver and/or wrench, multimeter and flat tool.\n\n\nUnplug your washer's power cord.\nUnthread any securing screws holding the top panel down, at the top of your washer's back panel. Depending on your washer, you may also need to remove the back panel to access the control board and its wire harness connections.\nSlide the top panel forward and use a putty knife or other flat tool to lift the top panel of your washer.\nLocate the lid lock underneath the top panel, and use a screwdriver to unthread it or release its securing clips. Then, trace its wire harness and disconnect it.\nInspect the lock for any damage, and then use a multimeter in the ohms setting (Rx1) and touch each probe to a terminal on the lock; the reading should be infinity. Depress it and the reading should be zero - if not, it needs to be replaced.\nInstall the new (or existing) lid lock and by securing it with the necessary screws or clips, and by plugging in the necessary wire harness to the control board.\nSecure the top panel of the washer, and secure the back panel of the washer.\nPlug the washer back in and monitor for any other locking issues.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Control Board to Fix a Top-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nAny issues with a top-load washer, including any issues where the locking mechanism is not working or engaging, can ultimately boil down to the control board not working properly. If this happens, it's important to replace the control board as soon as possible, as you won't be able to use your Whirlpool washer until you do so. Replacing a control board will require a screwdriver and/or wrench, and a set of pliers, if necessary.\n\n\nUnplug your washer's power cord.\nLocate the control board for your washer. Top-load machines normally feature the control board at the rear of the machine.\nUse a screwdriver or wrench to unthread the back panel of the washer.\nWith the back panel removed, locate the control board and take note of the wires connected to it.\nDisconnect the wire harnesses (with a set of pliers, if necessary), and use a screwdriver to unthread the securing screws for the control board.\nRemove the old control board and install the new one, and then secure it with the necessary screws.\nConnect the wire harnesses to the new control board and replace the back panel of the washer.\nPlug your washer back in and monitor it for any further locking issues.\n\n\nHow to Fix a Front-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nFixing a front-load Whirlpool washer that won't lock is not a difficult task. You will need some tools to inspect and potentially replace parts like the door latch, door switch, door seal and door hinge. But we've got the step-by-step instructions that will explain exactly how to do it, so you can quickly get your front-load washer back in fully working condition.\n\nHow to Replace a Door Latch to Fix a Front-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nThe door latch is an essential part in the washer's ability to properly lock shut. The door latch, also known as a strike, inserts into the door switch and allows the lock to secure the door completely. If the latch is broken, warped or damaged, it can cause enough of a misalignment for the locking mechanism to no longer work; at which point, it would need to be replaced. Replacing a front-load washer's door latch will only require a screwdriver.\n\n\nOpen your washer's door and locate the door latch. This will be on the inside of the door, opposite of the door hinge.\nInspect the latch for any physical damage. If it's warped, chipped, or broken, and unable to seat properly in the switch, it needs to be replaced.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread the door latch from the inside of the door.\nRemove the old door latch, and attach the new one - then secure it with the appropriate screw.\nClose your door and see if the locking issue is resolved.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Door Switch to Fix a Front-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nDoor switches, also known as door locks, work with the door latch to hold and secure the door shut during the washing cycle. When a door switch is damaged or bad, either physically or mechanically, it will cause locking issues and the cycle will not start, effectively rendering your washer inoperable. However, we have the instructional guide that you can follow to find out if your washer's door switch is in need of immediate replacement, or if there's another part that should be looked at. Replacing a door switch will require a screwdriver, a set of pliers, and a multimeter.\n\n\nUnplug your washer from the wall outlet.\nOpen your washer's door and locate the door switch, which should be on the door frame and identifiable by its female port.\nTo access the door switch, you will need to trace the door seal and pull the retaining ring and its spring out - this is best done by hand with a set of needle-nose pliers.\nWith the retaining ring out, you can pull the door seal away from the location of the door switch assembly. This will allow you to remove it.\nUse a screwdriver (or drill) to unthread the door switch assembly from the washer door frame.\nWith the door switch assembly loose, pull back the seal and handle the switch.\nDisconnect its wire harness and remove it.\nUse a multimeter in the Rx1 setting to test the switch for continuity while the switch is activated with the latch. Inspect the door switch for any signs of physical damage, and if the switch is damaged and broken, or does not have continuity, it needs to be replaced.\nPlug the wiring harness into the new switch and secure it being the washer's door frame.\nPull the door seal back onto the door frame and ensure it's sealed and flush within its groove.\nWrap the retaining ring around the door seal and use needle-nose pliers to pull on its spring to seat it within the groove of the seal. Ensure the ring is seated properly before continuing.\nPlug the washer back in and run a cycle to see if the locking issue is resolved.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Door Seal to Fix a Front-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nAlthough less common of a problem with a washer door locking than the previously mentioned parts, a door seal can be just as guilty at causing a misalignment for the door lock. Door seals, also known as boots, bellows, or gaskets, are used to ensure the washer door doesn't leak. If the door seal is damaged or warped, it can may cause the door or tub to not shut properly, resulting in the lock not being able to fully close. Replacing a door seal will require a screwdriver and a set of needle-nose pliers or flat-head screwdriver.\n\n\nUnplug your washer from the wall outlet.\nOpen the washer door and locate the seal around the frame of the door.\nInspect the seal for any warps, tears, or damage. If it's damaged in any way or not allowing the door to sit properly when closed, replace it.\nTrace your hand around the seal until you can you feel the metal retaining ring and its spring. Stretch the spring and pull off the ring to remove it. If the retaining ring is warped, bent, or severely stretched, replace it.\nWith the ring out, begin to pull the seal away from the washer door frame. Depending on your model, you may need to use a screwdriver or drill to unthread a securing screw inside the washer.\nRemove the old seal and insert the new one. Install it by carefully wrapping it around the inner tub of the washer, and then securing it with a screw if necessary for your model. If this is too difficult to do by hand, you may need to remove the front panel of the washer by first removing the top panel, and then carefully disassembling the front assembly.\nOnce the new seal is installed, ensure it's wrapped around the door frame of the washer, and then wrap the retaining ring around it to secure it in place - this may be most easily done with pliers.\nOnce the new seal is installed, close the washer door and see if the locking issue is resolved.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Door Hinge to Fix a Front-Load Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Lock\nThe hinge to any appliance, especially Whirlpool washers, will cause closing, locking, and securing issues if it's bent or damaged in any way.

Once you have checked these common issues, then you will need to investigate the filter, water line, inlet valve, thermostat, control board, condenser coils, door switch, and door seal for signs of malfunction. Use this guide to help you quickly identify which of these issues are the cause behind your ice-making problems and learn how to fix them using the step-by-step instructions provided.\n\nCommon Causes of Ice Maker Problems\n\nWater Supply is Off: Check that the water supply to the refrigerator is turned on and that the water line isn't blocked or kinked. It may also be helpful to measure your home's water pressure to ensure your fridge is receiving enough water. The pressure should be at least 20 PSI.\nIce Maker is Off: Check that the ice maker switch is turned on. You can find the switch behind the ice bucket. \nIce Maker is New: If you have just recently purchased your refrigerator, you should wait at least 24 hours before attempting to dispense any ice from the ice maker. \nIncorrect Temperature Settings: If the temperature in your freezer is too high the ice maker will be unable to freeze the water needed for making ice. The ideal temperature is between 0 degrees Fahrenheit or -18 degrees Celsius.\nIce Maker Bin is Frozen: Over time, large ice blocks can form in the ice bucket if it is not periodically emptied or cleaned. You can remove the stuck ice using warm water, or a hair dryer. Take your time and be careful not to damage the bin.\nControl/Shutoff Arm is Not Engaged: The ice maker control arm senses the amount of ice in the ice bin. Once the bin is full, the arm is pushed upwards to turn off the ice maker. The arm may become stuck in this position. Simply, lower the arm to to continue producing ice.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Bosch Door Seal\nA defective door seal can allow warm air to enter the refrigerator, causing temperature fluctuations. This can affect the ice maker's ability to freeze water properly and result in less or no ice production.\n\nPrepare the new seal by soaking it in warm water to make it more pliable and easier to work with.\nCarefully peel back the old door seal from the refrigerator door. You may need to use a putty knife or a flathead screwdriver to help loosen it.\nRemove any dirt, debris, or adhesive residue on the surface of the door to ensure a proper seal with the new gasket.\nBegin by positioning the new door seal at one corner of the refrigerator door.\nPress the seal firmly into place along the entire perimeter of the door, ensuring that it sits flush and snugly against the door surface.\nOnce the new seal is installed, close the refrigerator door and check for any gaps or unevenness.

If your Frigidaire dishwasher won't drain, it is most likely due to a blocked filter. Other common causes include blockages in the drain pump, drain hose, and garbage disposal, a faulty check valve or drain valve, or an improperly installed air gap. Whether you're a seasoned DIY enthusiast or new to DIY repairs, we'll help you understand how to diagnose and address drainage issues in your Frigidaire dishwasher to save you time, money, and the hassle of dealing with a malfunctioning appliance.\n\nSigns Your Frigidaire Dishwasher is Not Draining Properly\n\nStanding Water: If you notice water pooling at the bottom of the dishwasher after a cycle has been completed, this is an indication that the appliance isn't draining properly.\nFoul Odors: If water is unable to drain from the dishwasher, bacteria and mold can grow rapidly, leading to unpleasant odors.\nWater Backup: If there is water backing up into the sink from the dishwasher drain during or after a wash cycle, then this is a sign that the air gap is blocked or there may be an obstruction in the drainage system.\nDirty Dishes: If the wastewater produced during cleaning is unable to leave the dishwasher, it will be recirculated onto the dishes. This will leave your dishes with bits of debris on them or white spots. This is most often a sign of a clogged filter.\nSlow Drainage: If you notice that the water takes longer than usual to drain from the dishwasher, it could indicate a partial blockage in the drain system.\nUnusual Noises: A gurgling or humming sound coming from the dishwasher during the drain cycle can indicate a drainage issue, potentially caused by a clog.\nError Codes: If your dishwasher displays the i20, i40, or iF0 error codes, this is an indication that there is a problem with the drain line or filter that is preventing water from flowing freely. You can check your dishwasher's manual for information on interpreting error codes.\n\n\nHow a Clogged Frigidaire Dishwasher Filter Causes Poor Drainage\nThe dishwasher filter is a component designed to catch food particles, debris, and other solid materials during the wash cycle to prevent them from recirculating onto dishes and clogging the dishwasher's pump or drain. A clogged filter is the most common cause of drainage issues. If the filter is blocked with food debris and other particles, water will be unable to flow out of the dishwasher at the end of the wash cycle. It is recommended to clean the dishwasher filter at least once a month. If the filter is damaged and no longer functioning then it will need to be replaced to fix the drainage problem. You can browse our list of genuine OEM Frigidaire dishwasher filters to find the right one for your model.\n\nHow to Clean a Blocked Filter to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nDisconnect the dishwasher from the power outlet and turn off the water supply.\nOpen the dishwasher door and pull the bottom rack out of the dishwasher.\nPull off the lower spray arm to access the filter.\nPress down on the locking tab to release the filter. Pull the filter out of the dishwasher.\nCarefully remove any large pieces of debris with your fingers and then use warm water and mild dish soap to clean any remaining residue.\nThoroughly rinse the filter and wait for it to dry before returning it to the dishwasher.\nOnce dry, reposition the filter inside the dishwasher and ensure it is locked in place.\nReconnect the spray arm and slide the lower rack back in place.\nReconnect the dishwasher to the power outlet and check that it is now functioning properly.\n\n\nHow a Blocked Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Hose Causes Poor Drainage\nThe drain hose is a flexible tube that connects the dishwasher's drain pump to either the kitchen sink drain or the garbage disposal. It is responsible for transporting wastewater out of the dishwasher during the drain cycle. If the drain hose becomes kinked, or clogged with debris, it can obstruct the flow of water, preventing proper drainage from the dishwasher. Additionally, if the drain hose is damaged or cracked, it may leak water, which can also interfere with the dishwasher's ability to drain efficiently.\n\nHow to Clean a Blocked Drain Hose to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nRemove the access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher and locate the junction box.\nNote the orientation of the wire harness connected to the junction box and pull the wire connectors off.\nUnthread the screws from the mounting brackets that secure the dishwasher inside the cabinet opening.\nLocate the drain hose on your dishwasher. It's usually located at the back of the dishwasher, leading from the dishwasher tub to either the sink drain or garbage disposal.\nPull the dishwasher forward to access the back of the appliance, where the drain hose is connected.\nCheck that the hose is free of any kinks, twists, or sharp bends. If none are present, you will need to check the hose for obstructions.\nDisconnect the drain hose from the pump and the kitchen sink drain.\nInspect the drain hose for any visible clogs or debris. Run high-pressure water through the hose to dislodge any stuck debris.\nIf there are still clogs, you can use a long, flexible brush to gently scrub the inside of the hose. Make sure to use a brush that won't damage the hose material.\nOnce the hose is clean, reconnect it to the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure all connections are secure to prevent leaks.\nAfter reassembly, run a test cycle on your dishwasher to ensure everything is working properly and there are no leaks.\n\n\nHow a Blocked Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Pump Causes Poor Drainage\nThe drain pump is responsible for pumping water out of the dishwasher during the draining cycle. It typically consists of a motor and impeller that creates suction to remove wastewater from the dishwasher and expel it through the drain hose. If the drain pump becomes clogged with debris, such as food particles or grease, or if it malfunctions due to wear and tear, it can prevent the dishwasher from draining properly. Additionally, if there are issues with the pump's motor or impeller, it may not be able to generate enough suction to effectively remove water from the dishwasher, resulting in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher at the end of a cycle. You can find the drain pump located at the bottom of the unit.\n\nHow to Clean a Blocked Drain Pump to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nBegin by disconnecting the dishwasher from the power source and shutting off the water supply.\nRemove the screws that secure the front access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher.\nDisconnect the power wires connected to the junction box and remove the mounting screws that hold the dishwasher to the cabinet. \nDisconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal.\nPull out the dishwasher and tip it over so that it is lying on its rear panel.\nVisually inspect the drain pump area for any visible debris or blockages. Remove any large debris you can reach with your fingers or a pair of tweezers.\nUse a screwdriver or pliers to remove any fasteners holding the drain pump in place, then carefully pull the drain pump out of its housing.\nTake a picture of how the wire connectors are routed and disconnect the wire connectors.\nInspect the impeller for any obstructions or signs of damage.\nUse a soft brush or cloth to clean the impeller and the inside of the pump housing. Ensure that the impeller can spin freely.\nOnce you've cleaned the drain pump and removed any blockages, you can reassemble the dishwasher in reverse order.\nSlide the dishwasher back into place, and restore power to the unit.\nRun a short cycle to test if the drain pump is working properly and if the blockage has been cleared.\n\n\nHow a Blocked Dishwasher Garbage Disposal Causes Poor Drainage\nIf you have recently installed the garbage disposal, make sure the knockout plug has been removed from the drain tube. This is often the most common cause of drainage issues in new dishwashers. If the garbage disposal is not new, then it may be blocked. If large amounts of grease, food particles, or other debris are regularly disposed of through the garbage disposal, they can accumulate over time, leading to blockages that affect drainage from both the sink and dishwasher. When you run the dishwasher, water may back up into the dishwasher instead of draining properly. You will need to clear the blockage to fix your dishwasher.\n\nHow to Clean a Blocked Garbage Disposal to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nUse pliers or tongs: Using a pair of pliers to keep your hands safe from the blades, reach into the disposal opening and remove any obstructions. You can also use a flashlight to get a better view.\nUse a plunger: If you notice standing water in the sink as well, you can use a plunger to release any stuck debris. Place the plunger over the disposal drain and plunge up and down in quick succession to build up water pressure and loosen the debris. Flush the drain and get rid of any lingering waste.\nUse a cleaner tablet: You can purchase a drain cleaning tablet from your local hardware store and place it inside the disposal to get rid of any stubborn residue. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the best results.\n\n\nHow a Clogged Dishwasher Air Gap Causes Poor Drainage \nAn air gap is a device used in many plumbing systems to prevent dirty water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher. It's essentially a small, vented cylinder mounted above the sink that allows air to flow into the dishwasher drain line, preventing a vacuum from forming and interfering with drainage. If the air gap becomes clogged with debris such as food particles, grease, or soap scum, water will be unable to drain out of the dishwasher. Additionally, if the air gap is not installed correctly or is installed at an incorrect height, it can lead to drainage problems. For example, if the air gap is installed too low, it may not provide enough clearance for proper drainage, causing water to back up into the dishwasher. \n\nHow to Clean the Air Gap to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nRemove the cover from the air gap by simply lifting it or twisting it off. \nInspect the inside of the air gap for any debris or buildup and use a small brush or a pipe cleaner, to clean out any debris. \nUse a mixture of warm water and mild dish soap to remove any stubborn residue.\nCheck the hose from the air gap to the sink drain or garbage disposal to make sure it is not clogged. Flush it with high-pressure water to clear out any debris.\nInspect the vent and diverter inside the air gap to ensure they are working properly.\nCheck that the air gap is installed at least 1 inch above the flood level rim to ensure proper operation. The flood level is typically at the top of the sink basin or slightly below the rim. You can check your local plumbing codes to determine the specific height requirements for air gap installations.\nOnce the air gap is clean and correctly positioned, you can reattach the cover and check that the dishwasher is functioning properly.\n\n\nHow a Faulty Frigidaire Dishwasher Check Valve Causes Poor Drainage\nThe check valve is a small mechanical device that helps to prevent water from flowing back into the dishwasher after it has been drained. A common check valve problem is when the valve gets stuck in a closed position, resulting in draining problems. The check valve can also wear out over time or become damaged. If the valve becomes cracked, broken, or otherwise compromised, it will be able to function properly, resulting in drainage problems.\n\nHow to Clean and Replace the Check Valve to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nRemove the lower access panel or kickplate to access the valve.\nYou can typically find the check valve in the outlet of the drain pump. Refer to your dishwasher's manual for specific information on your model.\nInspect the check valve for any signs of damage, such as cracks or breaks, or any debris that may be blocking the valve. \nUse a screwdriver or pliers to remove any fasteners that hold the valve in place. \nIf the check valve is dirty or clogged with debris, clean it thoroughly using warm, soapy water and a soft brush. Ensure that all dirt and debris are removed from both the valve and its housing.\nIf the check valve is damaged and cannot be repaired, you'll need to replace it with a new one.\nOnce the new check valve is installed (or the old one is cleaned and reattached), reattach the lower access panel. \nReconnect the dishwasher to the power outlet and run a short cycle to test if the check valve is functioning properly.\n\n\nHow a Faulty Frigidaire Drain Solenoid Kit and Drain Valve Causes Poor Drainage\nThe drain solenoid kit is a component responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the drain valve, which allows water to flow out of the dishwasher during the drainage cycle. If the drain solenoid becomes faulty or malfunctions, it can prevent the drain valve from opening fully or at all, leading to improper drainage. If the drain valve itself is clogged with debris or damaged it will be unable to open and close as needed. This can result in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher, incomplete drainage of water during the cycle, and potential backups in the sink. Take advantage of our model search feature to find a replacement OEM Frigidaire drain valve for your dishwasher\n\nHow to Replace Drain Solenoid Kit and Drain Valve to Fix Drainage Issues\n\nBegin by unplugging the unit from the wall outlet, or flip the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.\nAccess the drain valve by removing the lower kickplate/access panel. Depending on your model, you may have to open the dishwasher door to remove the screws.\nYou can find the drain valve near the dishwasher motor. The drain valve consists of the solenoid and gate arm mechanism. Carefully examine the valve for any signs of damage or wear. \nIf the drain valve is faulty, pull it out of the dishwasher, discard it, and mount a new one in its place.\nIf there is any dirt, debris, or buildup around the drain solenoid or its components, carefully clean it using a soft brush or cloth. Ensure that all surfaces are clean and free from obstruction.\nCheck that the gate arm moves up and down smoothly. Also, inspect the two springs attached to the gate arm. If either spring is damaged, it will need to be replaced.\nUse a multimeter to test the electrical continuity of the drain solenoid. If there is no continuity, it indicates that the solenoid may be faulty and needs to be replaced. Use our multimeter testing guide for step-by-step instructions on testing your solenoid.\nTo replace the solenoid, simply remove the screws that hold the solenoid in place, and press down on the plunger arm to release the old solenoid. \nPosition the new solenoid in the dishwasher and secure it with the mounting screws.\nReconnect the dishwasher to the power source and check that the dishwasher is functioning normally.\n\n\nIt is common for many dishwasher owners to experience draining problems at some point in the life of their dishwasher. By following the steps outlined in this article, including inspecting the drain hose, cleaning the filter and drain pump, checking the air gap and drain valve, and ensuring proper installation and maintenance, most drainage issues can be resolved effectively. Remember that performing regular maintenance on your Frigidaire dishwasher can help prevent future problems and keep your dishwasher operating smoothly.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Whether you own a central, ductless/mini-split, portable, or window air conditioner, this guide will help you understand how to clean your unit, which tools to use, and how to perform regular maintenance. If you have been having difficulties with your unit, such as musty or unpleasant smells, unusual noises, or your AC running but not cooling, then this guide is for you! From cleaning the air filters and evaporator coils to scrubbing the drain pan and clearing the condensate line, this guide will walk you through each step of cleaning and extending the life of your unit.\n\nCommon Signs of a Dirty Air Conditioner\n\nWeak Airflow: If you notice that the airflow coming from your vents is weaker than usual, it could be due to a dirty air filter, clogged ducts, or dirty evaporator or condenser coils.\nUnpleasant Odors: Dirty air conditioners can emit musty or unpleasant odors when running. This could be caused by mold or mildew growth on the evaporator coil or in the ductwork.\nVisible Dirt and Dust: If you can see dirt, dust, or debris accumulating on the vents, registers, or around the indoor or outdoor unit, it's a clear sign that your air conditioner needs cleaning.\nUneven Cooling: If some rooms in your home are significantly warmer or cooler than others, it could indicate airflow restrictions caused by a dirty air filter, clogged ducts, or dirty coils.\nFrequent Cycling On and Off: A dirty air conditioner may cycle on and off more frequently than usual as it struggles to maintain the desired temperature. This constant cycling can lead to increased wear and tear on the system.\nIce Formation: If you notice ice forming on the evaporator coils of your unit, this is a common sign of restricted airflow or issues with the refrigerant line. Both of these can be caused by dirt and debris buildup.\nStrange Noises: Unusual noises such as rattling, buzzing, or banging coming from your air conditioner can indicate a blockage that needs to be cleared.\n\n\nHow to Clean and Maintain a Central Air Conditioner\nCentral air conditioners use a network of ducts to distribute cooled air throughout the building. The ductwork delivers the conditioned air to different rooms through vents and returns warm air back to the indoor unit for cooling.\n\nClean the Condenser\nThe condenser consists of the fan, cooling tubes, and compressor and it is located in the outside unit of your air conditioner. Before you begin cleaning it, ensure that you have switched off the circuit breaker for the AC. Begin by cleaning the fins, which are the narrow slats of metal on the side of the unit, using a vacuum with a nozzle attachment. Remove any built-up debris, such as leaves and grass, which can reduce airflow and efficiency over time. While cleaning, straighten any bent or crooked fins using a butter knife or similar utensil, being careful not to damage them. Next, unscrew the grate that covers the condenser to access and remove the fan for cleaning, taking care not to disconnect any wires if they are connected to the compressor. Use a garden hose to clean the fan blades \n and then wipe the blades with a clean cloth. Finally, spray water through the condenser fins from the inside to clear any remaining blockages. Reassemble the components once they are all dry.  \n\nClean Air Filters\nThe air filter prevents dust and other contaminants from entering the AC unit. This prevents dirt from accumulating inside the AC which could lead to overheating and potential damage. The air filter also helps to keep the air fresh by removing pollutants from the air. If the air filter is dirty you may notice a musty smell from the air conditioner. Remove the front panel of the unit and pull out the air filter. Place it under warm running water, and gently scrub it with a soft-bristled brush. Once it is dry, return it to the unit and reattach the cover. \n\nClean the Drain and Hose\nThe drain line or condensate line carries condensate water out of the air conditioner. Connected to the drain pan is a drain line, also known as a condensate drain line or condensate drain pipe. Depending on your AC model, there may be a hose attached to the end of the drain line. This hose serves to direct the condensate water to a suitable drainage location, such as a floor drain or an exterior location. Use a pipe cleaner or a long-handled brush to clear any debris or buildup from the drain line. If the clog is stubborn, you may need to use a mixture of vinegar and water or a mild drain cleaner to dissolve it. Once the drain line is clear, ensure that the condensate drain hose is securely attached and free of kinks or obstructions.\n\nClean the Evaporator Coils\nThe evaporator coils are found near the front of the unit behind the air filter. Use a soft-bristled brush to carefully remove any dirt and debris. If the dirt is stubborn, you can purchase a chemical coil cleaner from your local hardware store as well. Be careful not to get any liquid or foam on the electrical parts of the unit. thoroughly with clean water. Rinse the coil thoroughly and reinstall the filter and front panel of the air conditioner.\n\nKeep the Area Around Your Air Conditioner Clean\nThe outdoor unit needs open space for it to run efficiently. Ensure that there are no bushes, weeds, or other large items within 2-3 feet of the unit. This allows air to flow freely and reach the condenser.\n\nHow to Clean and Maintain a Window Air Conditioner\nThe window AC unit is a self-contained cooling system that is designed to be mounted in a window or through a specially designed wall opening. They are relatively easy to install compared to other types of air conditioning systems and are designed for single-room cooling.\n\nClean the Grille\nMost window AC units have a front panel that covers the grille. Remove the front panel to access the grille and use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment or a soft-bristled brush to remove any dust, dirt, or debris from the grille. Pay attention to the fins of the grille, as these areas can accumulate a significant amount of debris. After vacuuming or brushing, wipe down the grille with a damp cloth to remove any remaining dirt or grime. You can use mild soap or a mixture of water and vinegar for stubborn stains.\nWhile cleaning, you should inspect the grille for any signs of damage, such as bent fins or cracks. Carefully straighten any bent fins gently using a fin comb or a butter knife. Once the grille is clean, allow it to air dry completely before reassembling the front panel and turning the unit back on.\n\nClean the Air Filter\nWhile you have the front panel removed, take the opportunity to clean the air filter. You can find it behind the grille. Depending on your model, the air filter may slide out or it may need to be unclipped. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to clean the filter. Be careful not to damage the filter while you do so. If the filter is washable, you can run it under warm water as well. Once the filter is dry, reinsert it into the air conditioner and reassemble the unit.\n\nClean the Evaporator Coils\nThe evaporator coils are responsible for cooling the air inside the unit. Over time, it is common for evaporator coils to become covered in dust and debris. Remove the front cover of the unit and apply a coil cleaner over the surface of the evaporator coils. Allow the cleaner to soak and penetrate through the build-up. Use a soft cloth or a nylon bristle brush to wipe all the grime. Once the coils are clean thoroughly rinse the coils until all the cleaner is removed. Once they are fully dry, you can reassemble the unit.\n\nHow to Clean and Maintain a Ductless/Mini-Split Air Conditioner\n The mini-split provides targeted cooling to various areas in the home without the need for ductwork. It consists of an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. You will need to inspect and clean both to keep your air conditioner running optimally.\n\nClean the Air Filter\nCleaning your air filter should be a regular part of your maintenance to avoid unpleasant odors, inefficient cooling, overheating, and unusually loud noises. Access the filter by opening the cabinet door and carefully pulling out the filter. Use a vacuum to remove all the dirt debris and reinstall the filter into the cabinet, ensuring that it is oriented correctly. \n\nClean the Condensate Pan\nThe AC unit removes moisture from the air as it passes over the evaporator coil. This water cools and forms water droplets which then drips down into a drain pan located beneath the evaporator coil. Remove the access panel of the AC and locate the drain pan underneath the evaporator coil. Remove any standing water in the pan using a cloth or towel and be careful not to spill any water onto the surrounding electrical components. Use a mixture of soap and water and a soft brush to scrub the drain pan. Once it is clean, rinse the pan and wait until it dries before reassembling the unit.\n\nClean the Outdoor Unit\nRemove any debris, such as leaves, grass, or dirt, from the exterior of the condenser unit using a soft brush or vacuum cleaner. Next, use a garden hose to spray down the grille and the fan cage of the outdoor unit. Carefully clean the condenser coils using a coil cleaner or a mixture of mild detergent and water and a soft brush to remove dirt and debris from the coils. Finally, check the condenser fan for any debris buildup and clean it as needed.\n\nHow to Clean and Maintain a Portable Air Conditioner\nPortable air conditioners are cost-effective appliances that provide users with flexibility and convenience. Unlike window or central air conditioners, portable units do not require permanent installation. This allows users to move them from room to room whenever needed. To keep your portable air conditioner running efficiently throughout the summer, you'll need to regularly clean and maintain various components.\n\nClean the Cabinet\nIt is important to clean the exterior panels of the air conditioner every few weeks. This helps to prevent dirt from building up on the surface and helps to maintain the appearance of the appliance. It also ensures that the AC isn't working harder to try and draw air through a clogged or dirty filter. Grab a soft, damp cloth and wipe the entire cabinet. Avoid using any harsh chemicals as this may leave abrasions on the surface. \n\nClean the Air Filter\nThe air filter in portable units is typically found either on the rear end or on the side of the air conditioner. It is responsible for removing contaminants from the air and preventing them from entering the air conditioner unit and damaging its internal components. Pull out the air filter and wash it under warm running water. You can also use a vacuum cleaner to ensure you thoroughly remove any dust particles that may still be trapped in the filter. A dirty air filter can lead to a host of various problems such as poor air circulation, a musty smell, or even damage to the interior components of the air conditioner. It is recommended to inspect and clean the filter at least once every two weeks. \n\nDrain the Storage Tank\nPortable air conditioners remove moisture from the air as they cool it. This moisture then condenses into water droplets, which need to be collected and disposed of to prevent the interior of the unit from becoming overly humid and to avoid potential water damage. This water is stored in a storage tank or condensate tank until it is ready to be emptied. If your air conditioner has an indicator light, it will flash when the tank needs to be emptied. Otherwise, you can check your user manual for specific recommendations on when to empty the tank. To empty the tank, locate the drain plug towards the bottom of the unit. Place a small dish or pan underneath the plug and then pull off the plug. Allow the water to drain completely into the dish and reconnect the plug. It is important to note that some modern units are self-contained and do not have a storage tank that requires cleaning\n\n\nStore the Unit Correctly\nBefore you store away your air conditioner, you should drain the tank, secure the power cord, and place it inside a protective covering. Store your portable air conditioner in a cool, dry place indoors. It must be away from direct sunlight, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Be careful not to place it in areas prone to pests as they can get inside the unit and damage it. You should also ensure that it is in an upright position to prevent damage to internal components and ensure proper ventilation.\n\nHow to Get the Most Out of Your Air Conditioner\n\nChange the Air Filter Every 6 Months: Regularly changing the air filter ensures proper airflow, reduces strain on the system and improves indoor air quality by trapping dust, allergens, and debris. Browse our list of genuine OEM replacement filters to find the right one for your unit.\nUse Smart Thermostat or AC Controllers: Smart thermostats allow you to program temperature settings based on your schedule, optimize energy usage, and remotely control your air conditioner for efficiency and comfort.\nKeep Your Doors and Windows Closed: Keeping doors and windows closed prevents warm air from entering and cool air from escaping, maximizing the effectiveness of your air conditioner.\nSet The Right Temperature: Setting the thermostat to an optimal temperature (typically around 78°F or 25-26°C) ensures comfort while minimizing energy consumption and reducing strain on the air conditioner.\nUse Right-Size AC For Room Size: Using the right-sized air conditioner for the room ensures efficient cooling without unnecessary energy consumption or wear and tear on the system. For example, portable air conditioners are best used for small to medium-sized rooms such as bedrooms or home offices.\nTurn Off the AC When You’re Not Home: Every time you leave your home, you should make sure to turn off the air conditioner. This helps not only to save energy and reduce utility costs but also reduces the strain on the AC unit and prolongs the lifespan of the system.\nLandscape Around the Outdoor Unit: Keeping the area around the outdoor unit clear of debris, vegetation, and obstructions ensures proper airflow, enhances efficiency, and reduces the risk of damage to the unit.\nVentilate Your Home: Proper ventilation helps remove indoor pollutants, excess moisture, and heat, improving indoor air quality and reducing the workload on your air conditioner.\nHave Your Air Conditioner Serviced: It is recommended to have a professional HVAC technician inspect your air conditioner once a year. A technician can help ensure the optimal performance of your unit by detecting and addressing potential problems early, thus prolonging the lifespan of your air conditioner.\n\n\nAs you can see, it is essential to clean and inspect the various components of your air conditioner unit regularly to keep it running efficiently and to extend the life span of the equipment. If you are unsure about any part of the cleaning or maintenance, it is best to call a qualified technician to avoid any damage to your air conditioner. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

A clogged or dirty filter prevents water from flowing out through the drain hose and results in dirty water collecting in the dishwasher sump. It is recommended to thoroughly clean the dishwasher filter every 3 to 6 months to keep your dishwasher running efficiently. However, if you have cleaned the filter but your dishwasher is still displaying the E22 error, then the blockage may be in the drain hose or drain pump instead. Use this guide to find and remove the source of the blockage to get your dishwasher running properly again.\n\nBlocked Bosch Dishwasher Filter\nThe filter is responsible for trapping food particles, debris, and other solid residues during the washing cycle. It prevents these particles from recirculating and sticking to clean dishes. It also helps maintain the cleanliness of the dishwasher's interior as well as the plumbing system. Aside from standing water in the dishwasher sump, other signs that the filter is blocked include longer washing times, sudden unusual noises, a smelly odor in the dishwasher, and debris/residue on your dishes at the end of a cycle.\n\nHow to Remove the Filter in a Bosch Dishwasher\n\nTurn the dishwasher off and disconnect it from the power outlet. \nPull the bottom rack out of the dishwasher and set it aside.\nRemove the bottom spray arm by lifting it upwards or removing the mounting hardware that holds it in place.\nLocate the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. \nTurn the filter knob/cap counterclockwise to disengage it and pull it straight up to remove the filter assembly from the dishwasher. \nInspect the assembly for any signs of damage. If any is present, you will need to replace the filter assembly.\nIf there is no damage, you can proceed to clean the filter. \n\n\nHow to Clean the Dishwasher Filter to Fix the Bosch E22 Error\n\nFirst, remove any large food particles/debris from the filter assembly and throw them into the trash. \nTwist the filter cap off to separate it from the filter screen for a more thorough cleaning. \nRinse the cap and screen under warm running water. \nUse a soft-bristled brush and dish detergent to gently scrub both and remove any stubborn debris. \nOnce clean, reattach the filter cap and the screen and let the assembly dry completely before returning it to the dishwasher. \nPlace the filter assembly back inside the dishwasher and turn it clockwise to lock it into place. \nReattach the bottom spray arm and return the dishwasher rack.  \nReconnect the dishwasher to power and check that the E22 code has been cleared. \n\n\nBlocked Bosch Dishwasher Drain Hose\nThe drain hose is responsible for transporting water out of the dishwasher and into the garbage disposal or sink’s drain at the end of a cycle. It is normal for the drain hose to become blocked due to a build-up of food particles and other debris. When the drain hose is obstructed, water is unable to drain out of the dishwasher properly and it collects in the dishwasher sump leading to the E22 error. \n\nHow to Clear a Blocked Drain Hose to Fix the Bosch E22 Error\n\nDisconnect the dishwasher from the power outlet or turn it off at the circuit breaker, and turn off the water supply \nRemove the dishwasher’s kick plate, also known as a toe-kick, to access the drain hose. \nUse a pair of pliers to compress the clamp that secures the drain hose to the dishwasher. It is advised to place a bucket or towel underneath the drain hose to catch any water that may fall out. \nVisually inspect the hose for obstructions and run high-pressure water into the hose to force any build-up out. \nIf this does not work, use a long-handled tool to push out the blockage. Be very careful not to damage the hose. \nOnce the hose is free of any blockages, you can reattach it to the back of the dishwasher and secure it with the clamp. \nReturn the kick plate to the dishwasher and reinstall the appropriate screws to hold it in place.\nReconnect the dishwasher to the power supply, turn on the water supply, and check that the error has been resolved.\n\n\nBlocked Bosch Dishwasher Drain Pump\nThe drain pump pumps the dishwasher's wastewater through the drain hose and out of the dishwasher into your home's plumbing system during the drain cycle. Over time, it can become blocked due to the accumulation of food debris, grease, or foreign objects like pieces of broken glass or utensils. Mineral deposits and lime scale can also block it. A malfunctioning drain pump can lead to water not draining properly from the dishwasher, causing issues like poor cleaning, leakages, or standing water in the tub. Depending on your dishwasher model, there may also be a second pump, known as a recirculation pump which is responsible for spraying water around the dishwasher. However, when dealing with the E22 error, the drain pump is the most likely cause.  \n\nHow to Clear a Blocked Drain Pump to Fix the Bosch E22 Error\n\nTurn off the water supply and disconnect the dishwasher from the power outlet. \nLocate the drain pump, usually towards the front of the appliance, and disconnect the hoses from the pump.\nCheck the inlet and outlet ports on the pump for any items that may be causing an obstruction.\nTurn the impeller to check that it is moving freely. \nUse a pair of needle nose pliers to pull out any hard-to-reach items. \nOnce you have confirmed that the pump is free of any blockages you can reattach the hoses and reassemble the dishwasher.\n\n\nBy following the step-by-step instructions in this article, including regularly cleaning the filter, inspecting the drain hose obstructions, and clearing any debris from the drain pump, you can prevent blockages and keep your dishwasher running smoothly. Remember that regular maintenance is essential for ensuring the efficient performance of your dishwasher. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Easy signs that your filter is clogged up is if you've noticed dishes coming out dirty, standing water, slow draining times, or abnormal smells coming from your dishwasher. Cleaning a dishwasher filter is easy and doable in only a few minutes, and this guide is going to explain what your filter does, how to clean it, and how to keep it cleaner for longer!\n\nWhat Does a Dishwasher Filter Do?\nWhenever you run a washing cycle on your dishwasher, all of the water that eventually makes its way into the drain pump and hose has to pass through a filter. Every dishwasher has a filter, some even have two, but their location and type will depend on your specific model. A lot of filters in newer models are designed to be removed for easier cleaning, and quickly checking your appliance should make the filter easy to find. The filter is an essential part of your dishwasher and single-handedly stops any food particles, food debris, or other objects from entering and damaging the pump.\n\nThis is why cleaning and maintaining the filter in your dishwasher is so important, it can save you from costly repairs and even extend the life of your dishwasher. If the filter in your dishwasher is working effectively it is preventing clogs, leaks, and damage to the drain hose and drain pump. The filter works to protect more vital and expensive parts in your dishwasher, and it means you don't need to worry about pre-rinsing and cleaning your dishes before you load them into the dishwasher. This is why we highly recommend you make cleaning and inspecting the filter in your Whirlpool dishwasher a priority; it is a simple task, and taking care of this part pays off.\n\nWhat Materials You'll Need to Clean Your Dishwasher's Filter\nNo matter what, cleaning the filters inside your dishwasher will require a few items to complete the job. Some of these are these are tools, while others are more supplies-oriented.\n\nWarm Water: To break down and ultimately clean off food debris, you'll need a faucet or sink with running warm water.\nSoft-Bristled Brush: Sometimes grime is tough and requires the help of a soft brush or old toothbrush.\nDistilled White Vinegar: Breaks down grime and food debris so your dishwasher can live a clean life.\nBaking Soda: Neutralizes bad smells, and helps to get rid of stubborn grime.\n\nHow to Clean Your Whirlpool Dishwasher’s Filter\nCleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher's filter is relatively simple, depending on which model of dishwasher you own. Some have easily removable filters that require no tools, while some need a screwdriver to access, and others simply don't remove at all. Knowing which model you own is important to this process, so it's important that you check your dishwasher's user manual.\n\nCleaning a Removable Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter With No Tools\nFor this process, you do not need any tools at all (except your hands, of course!). Note: If you need a brush to clean any part of the filter, only use a small, soft bristle brush. Do not use a wire brush or scouring pad (also known as a hard sponge), because they may damage the filter.\n\n\nOpen the dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack.\nLocate the filters at the bottom of the dishwasher. Some models may only have one, but many have two; an upper filter and a lower one.\nRotate the upper filter assembly a quarter-turn counterclockwise, and lift it out to remove it.\nWith the upper filter out, pull on the lower filter where the upper filter was, then lift it up and pull it out.\nRun both filters under warm water until all food particles are gone. Any harder to remove particles or calcium deposits may require the use of a small bristle brush to clean off.\nOnce both filters are cleaned, put the lower filter in first by placing each side under their respective locating tabs, and ensure the circular hole in the filter is lined up with the round opening underneath.\nInsert the upper filter in the opening of the lower filter, and slowly rotate it clockwise until it drops.\nOnce it drops, rotate it clockwise again until it locks in place. If you notice an arrow on the filter, it does not need to be lined up with anything, Just make sure the filter is locked in place and cannot freely rotate.\n\n\nCleaning a Removable Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter With Tools\nFor this process, you will need a screwdriver at the very least, although other tools like a socket wrench may be required if your model requires them.\n\n\nOpen the dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack.\nSlide the top dish rack out, and remove the retaining clips on each side by lifting them up and then towards you.\nRemove the top rack.\nUsing a Phillips-head screwdriver, unthread and remove the screws at the back and top of the dishwasher.\nUnscrew the lower spray arm by hand.\nUse a T15 (or whichever is applicable) screwdriver bit to unthread and remove the 3 visible screws securing the filter assembly.\nRotate the spray arm that extends to the top of your dishwasher approximately 45 degrees to the right (or clockwise) and lift it up to remove. Note: Inside the spray arm is a small plastic ring that will be important during reassembly.\nWith the spray arm out, unthread and remove the 4th screw, and lift the filter assembly out.\nPop the filter out of its assembly for cleaning.\nReassemble the filter assembly, and secure the first screw (last removed).\nPlace the spray arm back in, and rotate it 45 degrees left (counterclockwise).\nThread the 3 screws back in, then connect and secure the lower spray arm by hand.\nScrew in the final 2 screws securing the upper spray arm, then reinsert the top and lower dish racks.\n\n\nHow to Clean a Whirlpool Dishwasher without a Removable Filter\nWhirlpool dishwashers that don't feature a removable filter only have two options for cleaning; use a store bought or homemade cleaning solution, or contact a repair person to disassemble your dishwasher. Ultimately the former option is the cheaper and easier method to try first, which is why we have a quick guide to explain how to get your Whirlpool dishwasher filter clean with household items.\n\n\nFill a medium-large sized bowl 2/3 full with vinegar, and place on the top dish rack inside your empty dishwasher.\nClose the dishwasher door and run a normal cycle, with the hot setting if possible.\nOnce your dishwasher is done, open the door and remove any loose food particles.\nRemove the bowl and spread a light amount of baking soda on the filter and bottom of the dishwasher.\nClose the dishwasher door again, and run another normal cycle with the hot setting.\nRepeat this process every few weeks to allow the grime and mildew on the filter to loosen and drain properly, for a squeaky-clean and great smelling Whirlpool dishwasher!\n\n\nHow to Keep Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Clean\nUltimately keeping your Whirlpool dishwasher and its filter as clean as possible is easy and simple if you're able to routinely clean it. The frequency will depend on how often you run the dishwasher and how much you pre-rinse dishes before loading them into the appliance. For most, tackling this task every few months should be more than enough to keep things running well. To top off this guide, we have a few small things you can do every so often to keep your dishwasher filter in great shape for longer!\n\nRegular Cleaning\nSimply removing trapped or loose food in your dishwasher every so often goes a long way to keeping it out of the filter. And doing a quick vinegar hot wash cycle keeps the dishwasher interior nice and clean as well!\n\nClean Small Crevices\nMake sure to check your dishwasher's spray arms for clogs and food particles, because those will eventually end up in your filter. You can use a toothpick or small brush to clean out those tiny holes in the spray arms, or wherever else your dishwasher has hard to reach areas.\n\nUse a Dishwasher Filter Cleaning Solution\nIf manual cleaning really isn't your thing, you can purchase cleaning tablets and solutions from your local grocery store to break down tough residue and grime within your dishwasher and its filter. These tablets usually come in multi-packs, so you have a few for future uses too.\n\nReplace Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter\nIf you've disassembled your Whirlpool dishwasher's filter and it's damaged or beyond cleaning, it's time to replace it. Ensuring food particles and any other foreign objects cannot enter your drain system is important to your dishwasher's overall health and avoiding having to replace an expensive part like the pump. So if your Whirlpool dishwasher's filter is in bad shape, it's best to replace it now, rather than risking damaging your dishwasher even further.\n\nWith your Whirlpool dishwasher's filter completely cleaned or replaced at this point, you can sit back and relax knowing that your dishes are getting clean, and that you have the tools and the know-how to clean it in the future!

Whether you're tackling tough stains on your driveway or sprucing up outdoor furniture, low or no pressure can quickly derail your plans. The most common cause of pressure washer problems is often a blocked nozzle. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the root causes of low pressure, from clogged nozzles to pump malfunctions and provide step-by-step troubleshooting techniques to help you diagnose and resolve these issues with confidence. By the end, you'll know how to fix your pressure problems and restore your pressure washer's power and efficiency, ensuring that your cleaning tasks are completed with ease.\n\nLow Water Supply\nIf you are experiencing low pressure with your pressure washer, it is essential to first determine whether the issue is with the water supply or the pressure washer itself. Testing the home water pressure can help you identify if the problem is coming from the water source. Pressure washers require 20 PSI of water pressure in order to function properly.\n\nHow to Test Your Home's Water Supply\n\nTo ensure an accurate reading, turn off any other water-using appliances or fixtures in your home, such as washing machines, dishwashers, and showers.\nUse a water pressure gauge, which can be purchased at most hardware or home improvement stores, and attach it to your home's spigot. Ensure the connection is secure to prevent leaks.\nFully open the water outlet to allow water to flow freely.\nAllow the pressure to stabilize, and then take note of the reading on the gauge.\nMost residential water pressure falls within the range of 40 to 80 PSI. If the pressure falls significantly below this range, it may indicate low water pressure from the supply line. It is recommended to call your water supply company for assistance.\nIf the reading is within the correct range, the issue may be with the water supply hose. If the hose is too long, water will be unable to flow to the pressure washer. Ensure your hose is the correct length for your equipment. The standard length for a hose is between 20 - 50 feet. \nIf you do not have a pressure gauge on-hand, you can use a jug and a timer to test your home's water pressure. Place a 1-litre jug under the spigot and measure how long it takes to fill up. If it takes more than 6 seconds to fill then you likely have low water pressure.\nYou can double-check this by calculating the flow rate of the water. Fill up the jug again but stop when the timer reaches 6 seconds. Multiply the volume of water in the jug by 10 to get the liters per minute. If the flow rate is less than 10 liters per minute, this indicates low pressure.\n\n\nTrapped Air\nAn air lock occurs when air becomes trapped within the pump or water delivery system, preventing the pump from priming and generating the necessary pressure. When an airlock occurs, the pressure washer may fail to produce a consistent or sufficient water flow, leading to reduced performance or complete loss of pressure. Air locks can occur for several reasons, including:\n\nInitial Setup: When setting up a pressure washer for the first time or after it has been transported, air may enter the pump or water supply hose, leading to an airlock.\nWater Supply Interruption: If the water supply to the pressure washer is interrupted or temporarily shut off, air can enter the system and become trapped, causing an airlock.\nPump Priming Issues: If the pressure washer's pump is not properly primed before use, air may remain trapped within the pump, resulting in an airlock.\nLeaks in the System: Leaks in the pressure washer's hoses, fittings, or connections can allow air to enter the system and cause air locks.\n\n\nHow to Fix an Airlock in a Pressure Washer\n\nIf your pressure washer is new and has a priming feature, follow the manufacturer's instructions to prime the pump before use. This can help remove any trapped air from the pump and water delivery system.\nIf the pressure washer is not new, turn off the pressure washer and disconnect the water supply hose. \nHold the trigger on the spray gun or wand to release any remaining pressure in the system. \nReconnect the water supply hose and turn on the water supply to purge any trapped air from the system.\n\n\nClogged Water Inlet Screen\nThe water inlet screen is designed to prevent debris, sediment, and other particles from entering the pressure washer's pump and potentially causing damage or clogging. It is located at the water inlet point where the hose connects to the pressure washer. The screen acts as a barrier, capturing and trapping contaminants before they can enter the pump system. If the screen is obstructed, water will be unable to flow freely resulting in a weak stream when the trigger is pulled. It is recommended to regularly clean the screen to maintain the performance of your pressure washer. \n\nHow to Clean the Water Inlet Screen in a Pressure Washer\n\nLocate the water inlet either at the base or side of the pressure washer. It is where the hose is connected. \nDetach the cold water hose.\nRemove the inlet filter using long-nosed pliers.\nRinse the filter under warm water or use a soft brush to clean the screen. \nInspect the inside of the water inlet for any debris or build-up and carefully remove it if any is present. \nReinsert the screen into the water inlet and ensure it is securely fitted in place. \nScrew the garden hose back onto the water inlet. \nTurn on the water supply and power on the pressure washer. Check for any leaks and ensure that water flows freely through the machine.\n\n\nBlocked Nozzle\nThe nozzle is the exit point for the pressurized water generated by the pump. It is responsible for controlling the direction, flow rate, and dispersion pattern of the water stream. If the nozzle is obstructed in any way it will be unable to release water effectively. \n\nHow to Clean the Nozzle in a Pressure Washer\n\nLocate the nozzle at the end of the pressure washer wand. \n Carefully remove the nozzle and inspect it for signs of debris or blockages. \nGently scrub the interior and exterior of the nozzle. You can also use compressed air to blow out any foreign materials.\nIf the dirt is stubborn you can soak it in a solution of vinegar and water for several hours to help dissolve the build-up. \nOnce clear, reattach the nozzle to the end of the wand and ensure it is locked in place.  \n\n\nBlocked or Kinked Hose\nThe hose is a rubber pipe that connects the pressure washer unit to the water supply and to the spray gun or wand. It delivers water from the water source to the pressure washer pump, where it is pressurized before it is released through the nozzle. The hose is designed to withstand high pressure and exposure to various chemicals commonly used in cleaning. If the hose has any obstructions or sharp spends along its length, it will restrict the flow of water through the hose resulting in low or no pressure in your pressure washer.\n\nHow to Check the Pressure Washer Hose for Blockages and Kinks\n\nVisually inspect the exterior of the hose for any signs of damage, such as cuts, abrasions, or bulges. Pay attention to any areas where the hose may be bent or twisted.\nStraighten out the hose completely and look for any kinks or bends along its length. Kinks can restrict water flow and affect pressure output.\nIf you find any kinks, gently straighten them out by hand. Avoid using tools or excessive force, as this could damage the hose.\nDisconnect the hose from both the pressure washer and the spray gun or wand.\nUse a flashlight to inspect the interior of the hose for any blockages or obstructions. Look for debris, dirt, or mineral buildup that could be causing a blockage.\nAttach the hose to a water source, such as a spigot or outdoor faucet.\nTurn on the water supply and allow water to flow through the hose for a few seconds to flush out any debris.\nIf the water flow seems weak or restricted, there may be a blockage that requires further attention.\nIf you suspect a blockage, use a long, flexible tool, such as a plumber's snake or a piece of wire with a hook on the end, to carefully dislodge the obstruction.\nInsert the tool into one end of the hose and gently push or pull it through to the other end. Be careful not to damage the hose while doing this.\n\n\nFaulty Pressure Washer Pump\nThe pump is responsible for increasing the pressure of the water supplied to the washer. Its primary function is to draw water from a water source and pressurize it before delivering it to the spray gun or nozzle. If any of the pump components are faulty, the pump will be unable to create a force that compresses the water and increases its pressure. \n\nHow to Access and Test the Pressure Washer Pump\n\nEnsure the pressure washer is turned off and disconnect the spark plug. Make sure the water supply is turned off.\nRemove the pump cover/housing to access the pump. You can find the pump underneath the engine\nVisually inspect the pump for signs of physical damage such as cracks or leaks\nCheck that the connections are securely attached and free of debris or blockages.\nDisconnect the hose from the pump outlet. \nConnect a pressure gauge to the pump outlet where the high-pressure hose was attached. Make sure the gauge is rated for the pressure of your pressure washer.\nTurn on the water supply and power on the pressure washer.\nSqueeze the trigger to activate the pump.\nCheck the pressure gauge to see if the pump is generating the correct pressure. Compare the pressure reading to the specifications provided by the manufacturer.\nIf the pressure is significantly lower than expected, it may indicate a problem with the pump, such as worn seals, damaged valves, or a faulty pressure regulator. You will need to replace the pump if it is no longer in good working condition.\nAfter testing the pump, release the trigger on the gun or wand to relieve pressure.\n\n\nUnloader Valve\nThe unloader valve regulates the pressure within the system by sending excess water flow back into the inlet side of the pump when the trigger on the spray gun is released. When the trigger is engaged, the unloader valve closes, allowing water to flow through the pump and out of the nozzle at high pressure. However, when the trigger is released, the unloader valve opens, redirecting water flow away from the nozzle and back to the pump's inlet. This action relieves the pressure within the system, preventing damage to the pump and other components. If your pressure washer has no or little pressure, the unloader valve may need to be adjusted in order to increase the pressure. The unloader valve should always be adjusted while the pressure washer is running and the trigger wand is pulled.\n\nHow to Adjust the Unloader Valve in a Pressure Washer\n\nRelieve any pressure built up in the system by squeezing the trigger on the spray gun to release residual water.\nThe unloader valve is typically mounted on or near the pressure washer pump. It may be situated along the outlet side of the pump. Check your user manual for exact specifications.\nThe unloader valve will have an adjustment mechanism, such as a screw, that allows you to control the pressure output. Locate this screw.\nPlace a pressure gauge between the pump and the high-pressure hose.\nUse a screwdriver or wrench to rotate the adjustment screw clockwise to increase the pressure or counterclockwise to decrease it. Make small adjustments and test the pressure incrementally until you achieve the desired level.\n If you've achieved the desired pressure setting, lock or secure the adjustment screw in place to prevent unintentional changes.\nAfter completing the adjustment process, perform a final inspection to ensure that all connections are secure and that the pressure washer is in proper working condition before using it for cleaning tasks.\n\n\nFaulty Pressure Regulator\nThe pressure regulator works in a similar way to the unloader valve. It controls the pressure of the water being delivered from the pump to the spray gun or nozzle by adjusting the flow rate of water through the pump. If the regulator is worn down or damaged it will be unable to maintain the correct pressure levels in the pressure washer. If it is faulty, you will need to replace the pressure regulator in order to restore your pressure washer.\n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Pressure Regulator\n\nBefore starting any work on your pressure washer, ensure that it is turned off and disconnected from the power source. Release any built-up pressure by squeezing the trigger on the spray gun.\nLocate the regulator near the pump of the pressure washer. You may need to remove the pressure washer housing to access it.\nDisconnect the inlet and outlet hoses connected to it.\nRemove the hardware securing the pressure regulator to the pressure washer frame or pump.\nCarefully remove the old pressure regulator from its mounting location.\nPosition the new pressure regulator in place, aligning it with the mounting holes. Secure the regulator by reinstalling the mounting hardware and tightening it securely.\nReconnect the inlet and outlet hoses to the appropriate ports on the new pressure regulator. \nAfter replacing the pressure regulator, reconnect the pressure washer to the power source and turn it on. Test the pressure washer to ensure that the new pressure regulator is functioning correctly and that there are no leaks or issues with pressure regulation.\n\n\nDiscovering the causes and recognizing the signs of low or no pressure in you're pressure washer is the first step to getting your pressure washer back on track. Follow the simple step-by-step instructions in this guide to quickly identify the cause of the problem and fix it in no time.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Getting the most out of your dehumidifier during those times is crucial to not only making sure your home stays free of pests, mold, and excess moisture, but helps you avoid allergies, sticky surfaces, and dust buildup. This guide is here to explain exactly how to do that, and how to keep your dehumidifier working efficiently!\n\nWhat is a Dehumidifier\nA dehumidifier is an appliance with a series of fans and cooling tubes of refrigerant or adsorption material, that works by drawing warm air through its coils. When the warm, humid air contacts those cold coils, the moisture and water in the air turns into tiny droplets, that are then collected in a bucket inside of the dehumidifier. All that's left is for the air to exit through the fan grille vent into your home, and for the water to drain out of its hose.\n\nWhat is a Dehumidifier’s Purpose?\nDehumidifiers are used to reduce the amount of humidity and moisture in a room or home by pulling in and cooling down the humid air, and replacing it with cooler and dryer air. They are particularly useful after water leaks and floods to remove excess moisture that collects in the air, and many people also use them in basements or other areas of their home where humidity and moisture collect.\n\nWhy You Need a Dehumidifier\nReasons why you would want to get a dehumidifier range in severity and overall benefit to you and your home. But there are a few outstanding motivations for why someone would want to get a dehumidifier for their home.\n\n\nDust Buildup: Excessive humidity can lead to dust accumulating easier on surfaces in your home, since dust particles tend to settle more easily in moist environments.\nMold Growth Prevention: High humidity levels create ideal conditions for mold and mildew to grow. Mold can be damaging to the furniture and parts of your home, but your health as well.\nAllergy Relief: Dust mites, mold spores, and pollen, thrive in humid and moist conditions. People with allergies tend to suffer more when living in these types of environments.\nAir Comfort: Excessively moist air can feel uncomfortable and irritating on your skin. In addition, respiratory issues can worsen in increasingly humid and moist living spaces.\nCreaky Floorboards: Wooden floorboards absorb moisture, which causes them to contract and expand — this leads to creaking sounds, which can become a nuisance for some.\nSticky Surfaces: Humidity creates stickier surfaces, which can interrupt comfort, cleanliness, and overall wellbeing.\n\n\nHow to Get the Most Out of Your Dehumidifier\nWhen it comes to actually getting the most out of your dehumidifier, you'll want to consider a few things: what size dehumidifier to purchase, what settings to run it at, and how to maintain it. Each of these is as important of a consideration as the next, not only before you pick one up, but after you get it setup at home.\n\nSelecting the Right Size Dehumidifier for Your Home\nUnfortunately, buying any random dehumidifier and plugging it in isn't going to completely solve the humidity and moisture issues you're experiencing at home. You may get some temporarily relief, but there are are a few things to consider before you evaluate your options.\n\n\nPint Capacity: Dehumidifiers are measured by small, medium, and large models. Each of these models has a capacity to remove and hold water each day, which is measured in pints. Small models typically remove 20—30 pints, medium 30—40 pints, and large 40—50 pints.\nSquare Footage: Arguably the most important aspect of what type of dehumidifier you purchase is the room size. The larger the room or space, the bigger dehumidifier you'll need to adequately and efficiently remove moisture out of it. Take the length and width measurements of your room or space, and multiply them by each other to get the square footage. Hold on to that measurement for the next step!\nHumidity Level: By using a device called a 'hygrometer', you can accurately detect the humidity level within a room.\n \n\nDehumidifier Size Guide\nUse the following guide, with your room's square footage and humidity level, to assess which size dehumidifier is for you.\n\n\nIf your room is 400—600 square feet, and the humidity level is between 50—80%, a small model will work well!\nIf your room is 600—800 square feet, and the humidity level is between 50—60%, a medium sized dehumidifier will work great! However, if your room has a humidity level over 70%, consider a large model.\nIf your room is over 800 square feet and has a humidity level above 70%, a large dehumidifier will be necessary.\n\n\nWhat are the Best Dehumidifier Settings?\nEvery home is different, and the conditions in which you use a dehumidifier will be different as a result. However, when considering the \"best\" settings for a dehumidifier, a matter of preference is involved.\nAn ideal humidity level indoors is between 30—50%; above that is when you begin to experience any of the symptoms like stickiness, and excessive moisture. When using a dehumidifier, you should change the temperature and humidity setting to whatever feels most comfortable for you. But understand that maintaining a dryer environment and cooler temperature will correlate directly to more power consumption, and higher energy bills as a result.\n\nTips for Using a Dehumidifier\nPlugging in a dehumidifier that's suitable for the room size and capacity needed will solve most people's moisture-related issues, but if you're looking to get the best out of it, these are the tips you need to optimally cool and dry your home.\n\n\nKeep Windows Closed: Closing windows prevents any outside air, that could be humid, from entering the room you're actively trying to keep cool. Open windows will result in the dehumidifier working harder, translating directly to higher energy costs.\nProper Ventilation and Space: Allowing air to properly and effectively circulate gives a dehumidifier the conditions to efficiently draw in moist air and release dry air. Avoid placing it against walls, or in tight corners.\nStable Surface: A stable surface for your dehumidifier translates to less noise overall during operation, and prevents accidental tipping or damage to the unit.\n\n\nHow to Maintain a Dehumidifier\nAs convenient as dehumidifiers are, there is a level of maintenance that comes with it to ensure it can perform optimally whenever needed. We'll explain the key maintenance items here, but our full dehumidifier maintenance checklist has even more important tips and tools.\n\n\nRegularly Clean/Change the Filter: Every dehumidifier has a filter, to ensure dirt and other particles stay out of your home. Clean this filter regularly every 2 weeks, or whenever the manual states as needed, and replace it if necessary.\nTurn Off Properly: Ensure that after every use, you are turning off the dehumidifier itself, and not unplugging it from the wall outlet. Failing to do so will result in its internal parts not cooling down properly, which leads to shorter lifespans, and potential voltage spikes to the most sensitive electronics.\nDrain the Water Bucket: As mentioned above, the water bucket in a dehumidifier will collect water over the duration it's on. Even if your model has an automatic drain hose connected, ensuring the water is properly draining will prevent overflows and shutdowns.\nTurn Off When No One's Home: Keeping a dehumidifier off when you're not home will ensure that your home is not over-dry, your energy bill is not as expensive, and the appliance enjoys a longer lifespan.\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Dehumidifiers\nTo assist you with anything and everything dehumidifier, we've compiled a short list of important frequently asked questions that people like yourself are asking every day.\n\nWhat are the Disadvantages of Dehumidifiers?\nAs convenient as dehumidifiers are for removing excessive moisture from your living space, they also pose their own disadvantages. For one, using a dehumidifier for any good length of time will add yet another appliance charge to your energy bill. In addition, models with smaller water buckets will need to be emptied more frequently, unless your model features an automatic drain hose connection. Lastly, dehumidifiers are generally noisy appliances, although some models are quieter than others.\n\nCan You Sleep with a Dehumidifier On?\nThe easy and short answer is: yes. If your bedroom is consistently above 50% humidity or is simply uncomfortable to sleep in due to the humidity, using a dehumidifier to cool your room and body will lead to a more restful sleep. However, it's advised that you avoid over-cooling your room (setting it below 30% humidity) and potentially aggravating respiratory conditions, dry eyes, skin irritation, and allergies.\n\nCan You Run a Dehumidifier in the Winter?\nAlthough it may seem like a bad idea, you are completely safe to use a dehumidifier during the winter, if a specific room or part of your home is excessively moist or has a humidity level above 50%. Note: It's important to remember if you live in a colder weather climate during the winter, using a dehumidifier could freeze the coils and cause issues with power efficiency, water collection, and could potentially damage the unit. Monitoring the temperature inside your home before and while using the dehumidifier will prevent any damage or issues with it.\n\nDo You Need a Dehumidifier in Your Basement?\nUsing a dehumidifier is not necessary in your basement, unless you suspect that any mildew or mold growth is caused by excessive moisture. Some homes have warmer basements by default, and in those cases, a dehumidifier is basically a requirement to prevent mold and keep the space cooler and more comfortable. If you suspect that issues with pests or mold in your basement are caused by humidity and moisture, contact an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) specialist.\n\nHow Long Does it Take for a Dehumidifier to Work?\nDepending on how large of a room you're drying, how much moisture there is to try in the first place, and the pint capacity of the dehumidifier you're using (assuming it's suitable for the square footage and humidity level), it can take 24 to 72 hours. Beginning the dehumidifying process as soon as possible will ultimately lead to quicker results.\n\nWill a Dehumidifier Get Rid of Musty Smells in a Basement?\nMusty smells caused by mold and mildew can be eliminated by a dehumidifier, but its effectiveness and how quickly it can eliminate the musty smells depends completely on its size relative to overall space, and how long you leave it running. As well, it's important to eliminate the cause of the smell at its source, whether it's mold or mildew; simply using a dehumidifier for an extended period of time will only temporarily fix the issue until the mold or mildew itself is removed.\n\nGetting the most out of your dehumidifier is important to significantly improving how comfortable your living space is overall. And now that you're equipped with the knowledge and know-how to make that happen, you can enjoy reduced humidity, better air quality, and an even more pleasant at-home experience!

You will need to inspect the air filter, coils, ventilation system, water reservoir, and drain line, as these parts are critical to the performance of your dehumidifier. If you've noticed lower performance, visible dirt on your unit, unpleasant odors, or water leakages then this guide is for you. From prolonging the lifespan of your dehumidifier to improving indoor air quality and reducing energy consumption, proper maintenance practices provide many benefits for both your home and your health.\n\nSigns that Your Dehumidifier Needs Maintenance\n\nVisible Dust or Dirt: If you see visible dust or dirt on the exterior of the dehumidifier or around the intake and exhaust grilles, it's a good indication that the unit needs cleaning. When dust and debris accumulate on the surface of the unit, this can obstruct airflow and hinder the dehumidifier's performance.\nFoul Odors: A musty or unpleasant odor coming from the dehumidifier can indicate the presence of mold or mildew. Mold and mildew can develop on the coils, filters, or inside the water reservoir if they are not cleaned regularly. Cleaning the unit thoroughly can help eliminate these odors.\nWater Leakage: If you notice water leakage from the dehumidifier, it could be due to a clogged drain hose, or a faulty water reservoir. You'll need to inspect the unit for any signs of leakage and address the issue promptly to prevent water damage.\nIce Formation: If you see ice forming on the coils of your dehumidifier, it may indicate that the unit is operating in a room that is too cold or that the airflow is restricted. Dehumidifiers do not perform well under 41 degrees Fahrenheit or 5 degrees Celsius. Ice formation can reduce the efficiency of the dehumidifier and potentially damage the coils. Ensure proper room temperature and ventilation to prevent ice buildup.\n\n\nItems You'll Need For Dehumidifier Maintenance\n\nGloves\nVacuum Cleaner\nSoft Cloth\nSoft-bristled Brush\nSpray Bottle\nPipe Cleaner/Plumbing Snake\nMild Detergent\nCoil Cleaner\nWater and Vinegar Solution\n\n\nClean the Dehumidifier Filter\nThe filter is designed to capture particles such as dust, pet dander, and other pollutants as air passes through the unit. The filter helps improve indoor air quality by trapping these particles and preventing them from recirculating back into the room. Regular cleaning or replacement of the filter is typically recommended to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the dehumidifier. It is recommended to clean the filter at least once a month. \n\nBefore cleaning your dehumidifier's filter, make sure the unit is turned off and unplugged from the power source to avoid any electrical hazards.\nYou can find the filter typically behind a removable cover or grille on the front or side of the dehumidifier. You can consult your dehumidifier's manual if you're unsure where the filter is located.\nRemove the filter and handle it carefully to prevent any damage.\nStart by vacuuming the surface of the filter, then carefully vacuum between the filter's fins to ensure thorough cleaning.\nIf your dehumidifier's filter is washable, rinse it under lukewarm water to remove stubborn dirt and residue and gently scrub with a sponge or soft brush. Avoid using hot water, as it can damage the filter. \nAfter washing, shake off excess water from the filter and allow it to air dry completely before reinstalling it in the dehumidifier.\nOnce the filter is dry, slide it back into place. Ensure it is properly seated and secured to maintain proper airflow and filtration.\nCleaning the filter should be part of your regular maintenance routine. Depending on usage and environmental factors, you may need to clean the filter every few weeks to once a month for optimal performance.\nIf your dehumidifier's filter is not washable or if it's damaged or worn out, you will need to replace it with a new one. You can browse our list of genuine OEM dehumidifier filters to find the right one for your unit.\n\n\nClean the Dehumidifier Exterior\nThe outer casing of the dehumidifier encloses all the internal components of the unit. The exterior surface can accumulate dust, dirt, and other debris over time, leading to reduced airflow and lower performance. It is important to regularly clean this outer casing to keep your dehumidifier running efficiently. This also helps maintain its appearance and keeps it looking clean and presentable. You should clean the exterior at least once a month.\n\nAlways start by unplugging the dehumidifier from the power source to avoid any electrical accidents.\nUse a soft-bristled brush to gently remove dust, dirt, and debris from the exterior surfaces of the dehumidifier. Pay attention to areas around vents, grilles, and controls where dust tends to accumulate.\n Wipe down the exterior surfaces of the unit, including the housing, control panel, and handles. Be careful not to let any liquid drip into the internal components of the dehumidifier. You can use a mixture of water and vinegar or a mild detergent.\nUse a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue. Then, use a dry cloth to thoroughly dry the exterior surfaces of the dehumidifier. Make sure there is no moisture left, especially around the controls and electrical components, to prevent any potential damage.\nIf your dehumidifier has casters or feet, make sure to clean them as well. Wipe them down with a damp cloth to remove any dirt or grime that may have accumulated.\nOnce the exterior is clean and dry, reassemble any removable parts, and plug the dehumidifier back into the power source.\n\n\nClean the Dehumidifier Drain Line\nMany dehumidifiers offer a continuous drainage option, which allows you to connect a drain line to the unit instead of manually emptying the water reservoir. This is particularly useful if you're using the dehumidifier in a basement or other area where humidity levels are consistently high. The drain line is connected to the dehumidifier on one end, and to a floor drain, or sink at the other end. If the drain line is kinked or becomes blocked, water will be unable to flow out as needed, resulting in leakages and potential water damage.\n\nAlways disconnect the dehumidifier from the power source before performing any maintenance to avoid electrical accidents.\nThe drain line is typically a small tube or hose attached to the back or bottom of the dehumidifier.\nCheck the drain line for any visible blockages, such as dirt, debris, or mold buildup. Use a flashlight if necessary to get a better view of the inside of the drain line.\nIf the blockage is minor, you can try using a pipe cleaner, flexible brush, or a small plumbing snake to gently remove the obstruction from the drain line. Be careful not to damage the line.\nTo guard against mold or mildew growth, use a turkey baster, funnel, or a small container to pour a mixture of warm water and vinegar into the drain line. This can help dislodge any debris or mold buildup.\nIf the blockage is stubborn, you can use compressed air to blow out the obstruction from the drain line. Be sure to use low-pressure air to avoid damaging the line.\nOnce you've cleared the blockage, reconnect the dehumidifier to the power source and let it run. Check to see if water is draining properly from the drain line. You can place a container under the drain line to catch any water and ensure it's flowing freely.\n\n\nClean the Dehumidifier Coils\nThe coils are located inside the dehumidifier and are responsible for absorbing moisture from the air. As warm, moist air is drawn into the dehumidifier, it passes over the cool surface of the evaporator coils. The temperature difference causes the moisture in the air to condense on the coil, forming water droplets. The condenser coils are responsible for heating up the collected water and turning it back into vapor or steam. This vapor is then expelled from the dehumidifier as warm air, leaving the water behind to be collected in a reservoir or drained away. \n\n\nAlways make sure the dehumidifier is disconnected from the power source before cleaning.\nThe coils are usually found behind the air intake grille or on the back of the unit. You will likely need to remove the filter to access the coils.\nStart by using a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any loose dust, dirt, or debris from the coils. Gently brush along the coils to dislodge the buildup.\nUse a coil cleaner or a solution of equal parts water and vinegar. Dampen a soft cloth or sponge with the solution, then gently wipe down the coils. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as they could damage the coils.\nAfter cleaning, use a different wet cloth or sponge to rinse away any soap residue from the coils.\nLet the coils air dry completely before reassembling the dehumidifier. This usually takes a few hours, but you can speed up the process by using a fan or hairdryer on a low, cool setting.\nOnce the coils are dry, replace the air filter and any other parts you removed during the cleaning process.\nFinally, plug the dehumidifier back in and turn it on to make sure it's working properly. Check for any unusual noises or odors that may indicate a problem.\n\n\nClean the Dehumidifier Water Reservoir\nThe water reservoir or condensate bucket is a removable container located within the dehumidifier where the condensed water accumulates as moisture is removed from the air. It serves as a temporary storage space for the collected water until it needs to be emptied manually or drained through a continuous drainage option. It is common for mold to grow and foul odors to develop in the water reservoir if it is not regularly emptied and cleaned. \n\nUnplug the dehumidifier from the power source before cleaning to avoid any electrical accidents.\nDetach the reservoir and empty out the old water.\nMix a solution of mild detergent with warm water in a bucket or sink and use a brush to thoroughly scrub the inside of the reservoir.\nAfter cleaning, rinse the reservoir thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.\nMix equal parts water and vinegar inside a spray bottle and spray the interior of the reservoir with the solution. Allow this to sit for a while to get rid of mold or mildew.\nRinse the reservoir and allow it to air dry completely before reassembling the dehumidifier. Make sure there is no moisture left, as any remaining moisture can promote mold growth again.\nOnce the reservoir is completely dry, place it back into the dehumidifier.\nPlug the dehumidifier back into the power source and test it to ensure it's working correctly. \nTo prevent the reservoir from getting dirty too quickly, you should clean it every 1 - 2 weeks, especially if you notice any signs of mold or mildew.\n\n\nClean the Dehumidifier Intake and Exhaust Grilles \nThe intake grille is where humid air from the room enters the dehumidifier. It is usually located on the front or side of the dehumidifier. The exhaust grille is where dehumidified air exits the unit and is released back into the room. The exhaust grille is usually located on the back or top of the dehumidifier. It's important to keep the intake and exhaust grilles clear of any obstructions, such as dust, dirt, or debris, to ensure proper ventilation and optimal performance of the dehumidifier. Inspect the grilles at least once a month for best performance.\n\nBefore you start cleaning, always turn off the dehumidifier and unplug it from the power outlet to ensure safety.\nSome dehumidifiers allow you to remove the grilles for easier cleaning. Check the user manual for instructions on how to remove the grilles safely. If they are removable, gently pull or unscrew them from the unit.\nUse a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any dust, dirt, or debris from the intake and exhaust grilles. Pay close attention to the grille openings and the surrounding areas.\nFor stubborn dirt or debris, use a soft-bristled brush to loosen and dislodge it from the grilles. Be gentle to avoid damaging the grilles or the unit.\nDampen a cloth with a mild detergent solution and wipe down the grilles thoroughly to remove any remaining dirt or residue. Ensure the cloth is not too wet to prevent water from entering the dehumidifier.\nOnce cleaned, allow the grilles to air dry completely before reattaching them to the dehumidifier. Make sure there is no moisture left on the grilles or the unit.\nIf you removed the grilles, carefully reattach them to the dehumidifier following the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure they are securely in place to prevent any gaps or loose fittings.\nAfter cleaning and reattaching the grilles, plug in the dehumidifier and turn it on to ensure it's working correctly. Check for any unusual noises or changes in airflow.\n\n\nHow to Get Rid of Mold in Your Dehumidifier\nDehumidifiers are designed to remove moisture from the air, however, moisture can accumulate inside the unit, creating a perfect environment for mold growth. As mentioned above, mold will most likely grow in the drain line and water reservoir inside your dehumidifier as moisture tends to collect in these parts. That is why emptying the reservoir every 1 - 2 days is important. If the unit isn't cleaned frequently or thoroughly, mold can develop on other internal components in the unit.\n\nMix equal parts water with white distilled vinegar to prepare a cleaning solution.\nPlace the solution in a spray bottle and spray all the surfaces inside the dehumidifier. Pay close attention to areas where mold is visible or water tends to accumulate.\nLet the solution sit for an hour and then use a soft brush or cloth to scrub all the surfaces.\nRinse all parts thoroughly with clean water to remove any remaining cleaning solution and mold residue.\nAllow everything to air dry completely before reassembling the dehumidifier and plugging it back in. Make sure there is no moisture remaining, as it can promote mold growth.\n\n\nLike any other household appliance, dehumidifiers require regular maintenance to ensure they operate efficiently and effectively over time. By following these dehumidifier maintenance guidelines, you can maximize the performance and longevity of your dehumidifier while minimizing problems like reduced efficiency, foul odors, water leakage, and mold growth. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

When this occurs, your dishwasher will shut off the water intake to prevent water damage to your home. With this guide, you'll learn how to systematically inspect these parts to clear the code.\n\nWhat Does the E15 Error Code Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher?\nFlashing ‘E15’ is your Bosch dishwasher’s way of telling you that it has detected water accumulating in the base pan underneath the appliance. This occurs during a leakage, as water travels down the dishwasher's double-wall hose and collects in the base pan. As water pools in the pan, it activates a safety switch, which then stops the water intake and displays the error code. This safety feature is called “AquaStop”, and it is designed to prevent water damage to your home.\n\nWhat Causes the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher?\nUnderstanding the potential causes behind the E15 error is crucial for effective troubleshooting. Several factors can trigger this code, including:\n\nLeaky Seals or Gaskets: The door seal or gaskets seal the dishwasher tightly during operation. Over time, the door seal or gaskets around the dishwasher can wear out or become damaged, allowing water to escape into the base pan.\nCracks or Damage to the Dishwasher Tub: Any physical damage to the inside of the dishwasher can lead to water leaking into the base pan.\n\n\nHow to Fix the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher\nClearing the E15 error involves two main steps: getting rid of any water in the dishwasher's base and then fixing the underlying cause of the leak.\n\nHow to Hard Reset a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code\nThe error code can sometimes be caused by a control board glitch that could be cleared with a hard reset. To do this:\n\n\nDisconnect your dishwasher from its power source for about five minutes. This gives the dishwasher’s internal system a chance to reset itself.\nAfter waiting, turn the power back on.\n\n\nIf the error persists, it means there’s water in the base of the dishwasher that will need to be removed.\n\nHow to Remove Water from a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code\nThe base pan catches any water that may leak or spill when your dishwasher is running. It is found at the bottom of the machine, underneath the main washing compartment. To remove water from it, you will need to: \n\n\nBegin by making sure the dishwasher is unplugged or disconnected from its power source, and that its water supply is shut off.\nHave some towels or a container ready to catch any water that comes out from your dishwasher during this process.\nGently tilt the dishwasher backward at a 45-degree angle to drain out the unwanted water in the base pan.\n\n\nEven though tilting the dishwasher might fix the error temporarily, you're likely to see it again if you don't find and fix the leak causing the water buildup. Be sure to inspect the dishwasher’s door seal, water inlet valve, and all hoses for any signs of leaks, as these are common sources of issues that could lead to water accumulation in the base pan again.\n\nHow to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Door Seal to Fix the E15 Error Code\nThe door seal runs along the perimeter of the dishwasher door, creating a watertight barrier to prevent water from leaking out during wash cycles. Open the door fully to expose the entire seal and carefully examine it. Look for any signs of wear or areas where the seal might have come loose. If the seal is compromised, it must be replaced. Replacement seals can be installed with a bit of patience. To remove a damaged door seal:\n\n\nStart at one end and gently pull it away from its groove. Most seals are press-fitted and do not require tools for removal.\nThen, clean the groove or channel where the seal sits.\nRemove any residue, food particles, or buildup to ensure the area is clean and smooth for the new seal.\nTake the new seal and begin to press it into place, starting at one corner and working your way around the door. Make sure the seal is evenly seated in the groove without any twists or folds.\n\n\nHow to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Water Inlet Valve to Fix the E15 Error Code\nThe inlet valve opens at the beginning of each wash cycle to allow water to enter your dishwasher. It then closes to stop the flow once the correct level is reached. If this valve does not close completely, it can lead to excessive water entering the dishwasher, potentially resulting in leaks. To inspect the valve:\n\n\nFind the inlet valve at the bottom front section of your dishwasher, behind the lower kickplate or access panel. You’ll need to remove this panel with a screwdriver to reach the valve.\nVisually examine it for any signs of wear or corrosion. This might include water marks, rust, or mineral deposits on or around the valve.\n\n\nIf you find yourself needing to install a new water valve, follow these steps:\n\n\nDisconnect the electrical connectors from the existing inlet valve. Take note of how the wires were attached for reassembly.\nUse pliers or an adjustable wrench to loosen and disconnect the water supply line from the valve. Be prepared for some water to spill out.\nUnscrew any mounting screws holding the existing valve in place. Once freed, remove it.\nPosition the new valve and secure it with screws.\nReattach the water supply line and electrical connectors, ensuring a snug and secure fit.\n\n\nHow to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Hose to Fix the E15 Error Code\n\nThe supply line hose brings fresh water into the dishwasher, while the drain hose carries wastewater away. Generally, you can find the supply hose attached to the water inlet valve at the bottom of the dishwasher, often accessible from the front lower panel. The drain hose usually runs from the dishwasher pump to the sink drain or garbage disposal.\nInspect the hoses for any signs of wear. Connections should be tight and secure to prevent water from escaping. If you discover damage on them, purchasing replacement hoses is necessary. To replace a hose:\n\n\nLoosen the clamps or fittings securing the hose to the dishwasher and to the water supply or drain.\nRoute the new hose similarly to the old one, connecting it to the appropriate points on the dishwasher and the water supply or drainage system.\nSecure all connections with clamps or fittings.\n\n\nHow to Reset the Bosch Dishwasher Safety Switch to Fix the E15 Error Code\nThe safety switch monitors the water levels in the dishwasher's base. It works in conjunction with a polystyrene or Styrofoam disk that floats upwards as water accumulates. If the water level becomes too high, the floating disk activates the safety switch, which signals the dishwasher to display the error. The safety switch is located at the bottom of the dishwasher. To access the switch:\n\n\nRemove the outer door panel and the dishwasher’s kickplate. The type of screwdriver needed (T20 or T15 Torx, or a Phillips-head) for this step depends on your dishwasher model.\nOnce removed, the safety switch should be visible in the center of the machine. Twist and pull the safety switch to release it from its position.\nCarefully lift out the disk. This is the perfect opportunity to inspect it for damage and to clean the area beneath it.\nAfter cleaning and drying the components and the basin, reposition the disk and securely reattach the safety switch.\nEnsure there are no obstructions and that the disk can move freely.\n\n\nKeeping up with routine maintenance can help avoid E15 error codes in the future. If these solutions don't resolve the issue, it might be time to call in an expert or reach out to Bosch’s customer support for advice.

It is an airtight seal that prevents cold air from escaping the refrigerator and keeps warm air from entering. If the door seal becomes torn, loose, or dirty, your refrigerator will be unable to cool properly, and your food may eventually become spoiled. The refrigerator will also consume more energy as it has to work harder to maintain the correct temperatures, leading to premature wear and increased energy bills. Finally, if your door seal is faulty, you will also likely notice increased condensation on the interior walls of the refrigerator as well as on your food. Therefore, it is important to fix any tears promptly, perform regular cleaning, or replace the door seal if it is no longer in good working condition. \n\nHow to Check for Door Seal Failure\nVisual Inspection\n\nClose the refrigerator door and carefully examine the seal around the entire perimeter of the door.\nLook for any visible gaps or areas where the seal is not making full contact with the refrigerator cabinet.\nCheck for signs of damage such as tears, cracks, or deformities in the seal.\n\n\nDollar Bill Test\n\nOpen the refrigerator door and place a dollar bill (or any thin piece of paper) between the door seal and the refrigerator cabinet.\nClose the door on the dollar bill, ensuring that it is held firmly in place by the seal.\nTry to pull the dollar bill out from between the seal and the refrigerator cabinet. If you can easily remove the dollar bill without much resistance, it indicates that there is an air gap or leak in the seal.\n\n\nHow to Clean a Refrigerator Door Seal\nFood particles, debris, and dirt can accumulate on the surface of the door seal over time. As these contaminants build up, they can cause the seal to become stiff and less flexible. A less flexible seal may not be able to fit properly along the refrigerator door, resulting in gaps or air leaks when the door is closed. Build-up on the door seal may also lead to increased wear and tear. Therefore, if you are having difficulties with your door seal, it is recommended to begin by thoroughly cleaning the seal.\n\nMix a solution of mild detergent or cleaner with warm water in a bucket. Avoid using harsh chemicals as they may damage the seal.\nDip a soft sponge or cloth into the cleaning solution and gently wipe the entire surface of the door seal until all stains and build-up are removed.\nAfter cleaning, rinse the door seal thoroughly with clean water to remove any remaining detergent or cleaner residue. \nUse a clean, dry cloth to wipe the door seal. Ensure that the seal is completely dry as any remaining moisture can lead to the growth of mold.\nClose the refrigerator door and test the seal to ensure that it closes properly and creates an airtight seal.\n\n\nHow to Repair a Torn Refrigerator Door Seal\nIf your door seal has tears or cracks, you can repair these using silicone glue. It is a professional colorless sealant and it is a popular choice for door seals. You can also utilize PVC glue which is a transparent sealant with a shorter drying time than other glues. It is important to note that using sealants to fix tears in your door seal is a temporary measure and it is best to replace the door seal as a more permanent solution.\n\nClean the torn area of the fridge door seal and ensure the cleaned area is completely dry before beginning.\nCut a piece of wax paper that is slightly larger than the torn area of the seal. \nSqueeze a small amount of silicone glue onto the torn area of the seal and spread it evenly over the tear.\nCarefully place the wax paper over the silicone glue and press it gently into place. \nUse your fingers to smooth out any air bubbles or wrinkles in the wax paper and ensure that it is lying flat over the sealant.\nLet the silicone sealant cure according to the manufacturer's instructions. This typically takes several hours.\nOnce the silicone sealant is fully cured, carefully peel away the wax paper from the repaired area.\nCheck the repaired area to ensure that the silicone sealant has formed a strong bond and sealed the tear effectively. \nClose the refrigerator door and check that the repaired seal creates an airtight seal. \n\n\nHow to Replace a Torn Refrigerator Door Seal\n\nBefore beginning the repair, first prepare your new door seal for installation by soaking it in warm water for a few hours or using a hair dryer to soften it. This will make it more pliable and easier to install.\nStart at one corner and gently pull the old door seal away from the refrigerator door. You may need to use a putty knife to help pry the seal off.\nUse a mild detergent and warm water to clean the area where the old seal was attached to ensure a clean surface for attaching the new seal.\nStarting at one corner again, press the new door seal into place along the edge of the refrigerator door. \nWork your way around the entire perimeter, pressing the seal firmly against the door to ensure a tight fit. Make sure the seal is properly aligned and fully seated in the groove around the door.\nClose the refrigerator door and check for any gaps or areas where the seal is not making proper contact with the refrigerator cabinet. Adjust the seal as needed.\nAfter installing the new door seal, allow it to settle into place and conform to the shape of the refrigerator door. This may take a few hours. \nOnce the new seal has settled, check that the refrigerator door closes properly and creates an airtight seal.\n\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and effectively repair your refrigerator door seal. From cleaning and inspecting the seal for damage to using temporary repair methods like silicone sealant and wax paper, there are several ways to deal with common issues with fridge door seals. However, it's important to note that while these repairs can be helpful, replacing a damaged seal with a new one is often the best long-term solution for your refrigerator. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This error is commonly caused by a faulty relay board, thermostat, temperature sensor, main control board, or a blown fuse. However, in gas ovens, this error is most often caused by a faulty igniter. This article will help you discover the source of the heating issue and provide you with the steps to fix it in time for dinner!\n\nHow to Reset Your LG Oven to Clear the F9 Error\nThe F9 error may sometimes be caused by a minor glitch in the oven. The most common way to clear the error is to reset the oven.  The steps for resetting your oven might vary slightly depending on the exact model you own, therefore, it’s always a good idea to consult your manual when you are unsure. However, you can follow the methods listed below which apply to a wide range of LG ovens:\n\nLG Oven Soft Reset\n\nAccess the rear side of your appliance and unplug the oven from the power outlet. \nWait for 1-3 minutes and then plug back it in.\nTurn the oven on and check that the F9 code has been cleared.\n\n\nLG Oven Hard Reset\n\nLocate the circuit breaker behind the service panel in your home. \nTurn off the switch that corrects to the oven.\nWait for 1-3 minutes and then turn the switch on again. \nAllow your oven to restart and confirm that the error code is no longer displayed.\n\n\nFaulty Igniter in an LG Gas Oven\nThe igniter provides the heat necessary for gas to ignite in the oven burner and begin the cooking process. If the igniter fails to heat up properly or doesn't glow brightly, it may not ignite the gas, resulting in issues like the oven not heating up or taking longer than usual to reach the desired temperature. You can find the igniter near the back of the oven cavity. It is usually attached to the burner assembly, or mounted on the back wall of the oven. If your igniter is damaged, discolored, or covered in food debris, you will need to replace the igniter to fix the oven. \n\nHow to Replace an LG Oven Igniter to Clear the F9 Error\n\nBeginning by disconnecting the power supply to the oven and turning the gas shut-off valve off.\nDepending on the model of your LG oven, you may need to remove the oven racks as well as the bottom panel of the oven to access the igniter. \nOnce you have located the igniter, carefully disconnect the wires leading to the igniter. Take note of how the wires are connected so that you can reconnect them correctly later.\nRemove the burner shield and set it aside.\nRemove any fasteners holding the igniter in place and carefully detach it from the oven.\nPlace the new igniter inside the oven and make sure it is aligned properly with the burner assembly.\nRefer to your notes from earlier to reconnect the wires to the new igniter, and ensure that they are securely attached.\nAfter installing the new igniter, restore power to the oven.\nSet the oven to a bake or broil setting and check whether the igniter glows and ignites the gas burner. If the igniter does not glow, double-check the wiring connections and repeat the installation steps as needed.\nOnce you have confirmed that the new igniter is working correctly, reassemble the oven and your repair is complete. \n\n\nFaulty Relay Board in an LG Gas and Electric Oven\nThe relay board is responsible for controlling various electrical functions within your oven such as temperature regulation. The relay board receives signals from the oven control panel and activates the appropriate switches to perform these functions.\nIf the relay board is faulty, it can lead to issues such as poor temperature control, failure of heating elements to turn on or off, or complete oven failure. You will need to inspect the board for signs of physical damage or test it for electric failure. If it has failed, you will need to find a new relay board in order to fix your oven. If you own a gas oven you can typically find the relay board in the top right corner of the oven, whereas in an electric oven, it will be in the bottom right.\n\nHow to Replace an LG Oven Relay Board to Clear the F9 Error\n\nBefore starting any work on your oven, make sure to turn off the power supply to the oven at the circuit breaker top to prevent the risk of electric shock. Additionally, allow the oven to cool completely if it has been recently used.\nThe relay board is usually located behind the control panel or in a compartment accessible from the rear of the oven. It is a circuit board with several switches mounted on it.\nOnce you have accessed the relay board, disconnect the power supply wires leading to the board. These wires are typically connected with wire nuts or connectors. Take note of how the wires are connected so that you can reconnect them correctly later.\nRemove the fasteners that secure the relay board and pull it out of the oven.\nSeecure the new replay board in place and reconnect the wiring to the correct terminals.\nOnce you have installed the new relay board and connected the wires, reattach any panels you removed to access it. \nReplace the oven racks if you removed them.\nRestore power to the oven and turn it on to verify that it heats up correctly. \n\n\nFaulty Thermostat in an LG Gas and Electric Oven\nThe thermostat in an oven is a control device that regulates the temperature inside the oven cavity. It works by sensing the temperature and activating or deactivating the heating elements to maintain the desired temperature setting. If the thermostat is faulty, the heating elements may be unable to produce enough heat, resulting in the F9 error. It is best to replace the thermostat to restore the proper functioning of your oven.\n\nHow to Replace an LG Oven Thermostat to Clear the F9 Error\n\nBefore beginning any work on your oven, make sure to turn off the power supply to the oven at the circuit breaker or fuse box to prevent the risk of electric shock.\nRemove the oven racks and rear panel to access the thermostat. The thermostat is typically located near the oven cavity, usually on the back wall or near the oven's top or bottom.\nOnce you have accessed the thermostat, disconnect the wire harness. These wires are typically connected with wire nuts or connectors. Take a picture of how the wires are connected for installation later.\nRemove the mounting hardware that holds the thermostat in place and carefully detach it from the oven.\nPosition the new thermostat in the same location as the old one and ensure it is fitted in place.\nReconnect the power supply wires to the new thermostat using the image you took earlier.\nReassemble the oven and reconnect it to the power outlet.\n\n\nFaulty Temperature Sensor in an LG Electric Oven\nIn modern electric ranges, the temperature sensor or thermistor detects the temperature inside the oven cavity. It sends these readings to the control board which uses the information to regulate the oven temperature accurately. If the sensor is malfunctioning, the oven may be unable to increase the temperature properly, resulting in an F9 error. If the sensor is no longer functioning, you will need to find a new sensor to clear the F9 error. \n\nHow to Replace an LG Oven Temperature Sensor to Clear F9 Error\n\nDisconnect the power supply to the oven and remove the oven racks.\nLocate the temperature sensor inside the oven cavity, towards the rear end.\nRemove the screws that attach the sensor to the back wall of the oven.\nUse a pair of needle-nose pliers to remove the wire connectors leading to the sensor.  \nConnect the wiring to the new sensor and reinstall the mounting screws. \nReinsert the oven racks if you removed them.\nRestore power to the oven and test it to ensure that the temperature sensor is working correctly.\n\n\nBlown Thermal Fuse in an LG Gas and Electric Oven\nThe thermal fuse is a safety device designed to prevent the appliance from overheating. When the temperature inside the oven rises too high the thermal fuse breaks the electrical circuit and shuts off the oven. This reduces the risk of fire or damage to the oven. Once the fuse blows, it will need to be replaced, as it is designed for one-time use. You can browse our list of genuine OEM thermal fuses to find the right one for your oven. \n\nHow to Replace an LG Oven Thermal Fuse to Clear F9 Error\n\nUnplug the oven or turn it off at the circuit breaker to ensure your safety.\nPull the oven from the wall to gain access to the rear side.\nRemove the oven's back panel to access the thermal fuse.\nCarefully disconnect the wires attached to the fuse. It may be helpful to take a picture of how the wires are routed using your phone.\nRemove any screws or clips securing the thermal fuse and carefully take out the old fuse.\nTake the new thermal fuse and place it in the same position as the old one. Secure it with mounting screws or clips.\nReconnect the wires to the new thermal fuse. Double-check that the wires are connected to the correct terminals.\nReattach the back panel of the oven.\nOnce everything is securely reassembled, plug the oven back into the power outlet or switch on the circuit breaker to restore power.\n\n\nWhether you own a gas or electric oven, by understanding the potential causes of the F9 error, you can quickly troubleshoot and clear the code in no time. If you are unsure how to proceed at any point, it is best to call a qualified technician to help you resolve the problem. Remember that regular cleaning and maintenance will keep your oven in great condition for many years to come. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

In models that feature Express 60 capabilities, it means there's too much water in the dishwasher itself and you'll need to make sure the drain pump and drain hose are working properly. In models without the Express 60 feature, it means a leak has been detected by the leak sensor and the inlet valve, float switch, or fill hose will need to be inspected. Our guide will explain how to troubleshot this, to get your Samsung dishwasher working!\n\nWhy Your Samsung Dishwasher Lights are Blinking\nThe control panel on your Samsung dishwasher features a number of buttons for each cycle selection, and above those there are indicator lights. During the cycle, the indicator lights are letting you know what cycle is running and what features are selected. If no cycle is currently running, and you notice any of those indicator lights flashing or staying on, your Samsung dishwasher is trying to communicate an issue. Since there are no electronic displays to show you an error code, the appliance uses these lights to notify you what the problem is. It can be a single light, like this articles discusses, or a combination of up to four lights.\n\nWhy is Your Samsung Dishwasher Not Draining?\nSeeing a 'Heavy' light blinking on Samsung dishwasher models with an 'Express 60' mode, without any other indications, tells us that there's too much water inside of the dishwasher, and this normally indicates an issue with its draining system. This means there's a part not working as well as it could be, or broken enough to stop working properly. If your dishwasher has an 'Express60' button or 'Quick+' button, this would apply to your model.\n\nHow to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Filter\nThe first and simplest part you can fix is the filter in your Samsung dishwasher. The filter is designed to catch and trap any larger pieces of food debris from entering your dishwasher's drain and causing clogs or damage to the other more sensitive components. A clogged or damaged filter means water does not drain easily and food waste can more easily gain access to the drain system. This leads to further clogs and eventually too much water sitting in the dishwasher tub, which will raise the float switch and lead to a blinking 'Heavy' light. But we're here to explain exactly how to inspect your filter and either clean or replace it, so your dishwasher can properly drain.\n\n\nOpen your dishwasher door and locate the filter, usually at the bottom of the tub's interior.\nRemove the lower dish rack, and if necessary, remove the lower spray arm to gain access to the filter.\nRemove the filter and, if necessary, clean it by soaking it in warm soap and water for 5 minutes, and then scrubbing it with a soft-bristle brush.\nInspect the filter for any signs of damage, and if you notice any holes or other damage that would otherwise stop it from working properly, replace it with a new filter.\nReinstall the dish rack and spray arm, then run a quick cycle on your dishwasher to monitor for the code or if water doesn't drain properly.\n\n\nHow to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Hose\nThe next part you can troubleshoot if your dishwasher isn't draining properly, is its drain hose. The drain hose, as its name implies, is a plastic hose attached to your dishwasher's drain pump that allows dirty and food-debris-filled water to exit the dishwasher and be disposed of. If this drain hose is clogged or cracked, it will cause water to either build up inside the dishwasher because it can't exit, or cause water to leak in and around your dishwasher, This leads to the float switch detecting too much water, and a flashing 'Heavy' light. To explain how to find your drain hose and see if it's in need of a replacement, check out the guide below!\n\n\nLocate the drain hose either behind the dishwasher or below it, or by inspecting underneath your sink.\nRun a short cycle on your dishwasher and monitor the drain hose for any water flow stoppages.\nIf you notice the water stopping and/or not flowing consistently, disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet after the cycle is over.\nIf your drain hose is clogged, use a screwdriver or wrench to remove any clamps and gain access to the hose's connection point, and use paper towel or a tube brush to dislodge and remove the clog.\nIf your drain hose is also connected to a garbage disposal system, ensure it's turned off before you open it and inspect its interior for any clogs.\nIf you discover your drain hose is not clogged but is instead cracked or broken, it will need to be replaced.\nOnce your dishwasher's drain hose has been cleaned or replaced, run a short cycle to see if it drains properly.\n\n\nHow to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Pump\nThe most time consuming part that you'll have to troubleshoot in your Samsung dishwasher if it's not draining properly, is its drain pump. The drain pump is what facilitates the draining of the dishwasher, and in some models can be the main motor for the filling and draining of all water. If the drain pump is clogged or bad, it will cause water not to drain and instead buildup inside the dishwasher tub, and lead to the float switch detecting too much water, and cause the 'Heavy' light to start blinking. Whether there's something lodged in the drain pump or if there's a broken seal, we've got the guide to explain to you precisely how to figure out what's going on in your dishwasher.\n\n\nDisconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet and turn off its water supply.\nUse a screwdriver or drill to unthread and remove the kickplate at the bottom of the dishwasher.\nCarefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect the electrical junction box and drain hose.\nPull the dishwasher out, and flip it on its back by pulling and pushing its top backwards or to the side.\nTip: Keep a towel close by for any water spilling that may occur.\nUnthread and remove any plastic panels covering the bottom of the dishwasher, as well as the leak detector sensor wire.\nRemove the wire harness from the drain pump's terminals, and rotate the drain pump counter clockwise while pulling it towards you to remove it.\nInspect the drain pump for any clogs or damage, and remove any pieces of debris that could be causing the pump not to drain.\nIf there's nothing stuck or lodged in the pump, ensure you've checked the drain hose and other drain system parts.\nUse a multimeter to test the pump for defects or failures. If it doesn't read nearly zero with both probes touching the terminals, or one terminal touching ground, the pump likely failed.\nInstall the proper wires to the drain pump, and then install the drain pump into the dishwasher by rotating it clockwise and pushing on it.\nReplace the leak detector sensor, as well as the plastic cover panels if applicable, then flip the dishwasher back upright.\nPush the dishwasher back into place, and reinstall the fill hose, drain hose, and electrical junction box.\nReplace the kickplate and turn your dishwasher's breaker back on, as well as connecting the water supply. Then run a short cycle to monitor for any lights.\n\n\nWhy is Your Samsung Dishwasher Leaking?\nThe leak sensor in your Samsung dishwasher will blink the 'Heavy' light as an indication of water underneath it, if it's a model that doesn't have an 'Express 60' or 'Quick+' mode. This can happen for a couple of reasons, and we're going to break down the reasons and parts that would cause you to see the 'Heavy' light blinking on your Samsung dishwasher.\n\nWhere is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor?\nMost Samsung dishwashers have a leak sensor at the bottom of the appliance that will communicate with the control board when there is moisture detected. Accessing this leak sensor to troubleshoot your dishwasher isn't difficult, but it does require some tools and time set aside to disassemble the dishwasher itself. Lucky for you, we'll explain exactly where to find it and what to look for.\n\n\nDisconnect the power to your dishwasher, and its water supply.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher, then carefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve and disconnect its wires and drain hose.\nPull your dishwasher out and flip it onto its back or side, by pushing and pulling it backwards or to the side from its top.\nTip: Use a towel to clean up any water that spills out.\nUse a screwdriver or wrench to unthread the plastic cover panel at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nOpen the plastic cover and locate the leak sensor, which should be attached to it.\nInspect around the leak sensor for any dried soap or moisture residue that could point to a specific part underneath your dishwasher that's leaking.\nYou may notice dried soap or moisture near the drain hose or drain pump, and you can read the guides above for how to properly troubleshoot those parts.\n\n\nHow to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Inlet Valve\nIf any sort of leak is occurring underneath your Samsung dishwasher, it will very likely have something to do with its inlet valve. When you turn your dishwasher on and start a cycle, the fill hose routes water from your home's water supply, to the inlet valve. Any issues with the inlet valve caused by electrical failure or a plugged screen will result in water underneath your dishwasher and a detection by the leak sensor, and a blinking 'Heavy' light. The easiest way to resolve this is by removing the inlet valve and checking for any issues with it, and either fixing or replacing it, which we'll explain how to do.\n\n\nTurn off your water supply and disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet.\nRemove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher and unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect its wires and drain hose under the sink.\nPull your dishwasher out and flip it onto its back or side by pushing and pulling its top backwards or to the side, to gain access to the inlet valve.\nTip: Make sure you keep a towel close by in case any water spills out.\nRemove any clamps on the inlet valve and fill hose, as well as the attached wire harness.\nRemove the inlet valve and inspect it for any cracks or damage, or if there are any clogs in its screens.\nIf you notice signs of a leak from the inlet valve's area during any inspection, reassemble your dishwasher and run a quick cycle to observe any issues while it fills.\nTo test the multimeter for full functionality, you can use a multimeter to check the valve for continuity. Set your multimeter to x1 and touch the probes to each of the valve's terminals (this also applies if the solenoid has four terminals).\nIf the inlet valve reads infinity, the solenoid is faulty and the valve will need to be replaced.\nInstall the existing or new inlet valve.\nFlip your dishwasher back upright and into place, and reinstall the wires and its fill and drain hose.\nConnect your dishwasher's power and water supply, and then run a quick cycle to monitor for any leaks or error lights.\n\n\nHow to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Fill Hose\nSimilar to its drain hose, a dishwasher fill hose allows water to flow freely from the water supply to the inlet valve and be used to clean your dishes. If this drain hose is in any way clogged, kinked, or cracked, it can and will lead to leaking, which the leak sensor will detect and result in the 'Heavy' light blinking. But you can fix your drain hose by cleaning it or replacing it, depending on whether it's still in working condition; which we'll explain exactly how to find out for yourself!\n\n\nFirst off, you'll need to locate your fill hose underneath your sink and trace it to your dishwasher.\nThen shut off your water supply and the power to your dishwasher, by turning off its breaker.\nTake off the kickplate and disconnect the fill hose and its clamps (if applicable), drain hose, and the wires connected to the inlet valve.\nInspect the fill hose for any cracks or clogs. Use a paper towel or tube brush to clean the inside of the hose if any clogs are present. If it's damaged or cracked in any way, it will need to be replaced immediately.\nInstall the fill hose to the inlet valve and replace any clamps that were removed, as well as the wires and drain hose.\nTurn your water supply on and connect the dishwasher to power.\nRun a quick cycle in your dishwasher and monitor for any leaks or leak indicators.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Float Switch\nA part that could be responsible for the leaks in your dishwasher is the float switch, which is always handy to check to ensure it's working properly. The float switch, also known as the flood switch, detects how much water is in your dishwasher and activates the pump if too much water is present. The issue being that if the float switch is bad, water will continue to fill into the dishwasher and eventually leak out of your dishwasher, and cause the leak sensor to detect it, which is where you see the 'Heavy' light blinking. So if you're curious whether this part is working properly, read on!\n\n\nDisconnect power to your dishwasher.\nLocate the float switch in your dishwasher at the bottom of the appliance, underneath the spray arm, which will appear as a small round component.\nTo gain access to the float switch, you will need to remove the spray arm, dish racks, and unthread and remove certain panels within your dishwasher.\nOnce you've gained access to the switch, carefully remove it and disconnect any wires connected to it.\nUse a multimeter to test the switch for continuity, and replace it if it's bad or defective.\nWith the new or existing switch, install it into place in your dishwasher and secure whichever panels were originally removed, as well as the spray arm and dish racks.\nRun a few cycles in your dishwasher and monitor for leak detections or other issues.\n\n\nAt this point, your Samsung dishwasher should be revived from its unstable condition, and you've got it back to cleaning!

Replacing any of these parts is quite simple, but will require some tools and some DIY time!\n\nWhy is my GE Dishwasher Leaking from the Bottom of the Door?\n\nIf you notice that your dishwasher has a leak, there are some tell-tale signs to look out for to help you figure out which parts are ultimately causing the leak, which you can then inspect and replace or fix!\n\n\nReduced Cleaning Performance: Any amount of water leaking from your dishwasher can reduce the cleaning ability of the dishwasher as a whole, so if you're noticing a significant drop in dishwasher cleaning performance, like dishes not being cleaned fully, it means there's a part like the filter, inlet valve or drain pump that are causing it.\nMildew or Mold: Another easy sign of a leak or water presence in general is mold or mildew growth. Normally mold or mildew will also come with an unpleasant smell, so seeing or smelling it is an easy indication of a leak from somewhere underneath your dishwasher, such as the drain pump, hose or inlet valve.\nUnusual Noises: A not-so obvious sign that you may not think of is sound, specifically unusual sounds like gurgling or bubbling can be associated with a clogged drain hose or improperly sealed pump.\nWater Not Draining: If after a load of dishes you notice water still left in the dishwasher, it's a sign that one of the parts within the draining system for the dishwasher is either clogged or not working as it should, which could or potentially may already have resulted in leaks.\n\n\nHow to Fix a Leaking GE Dishwasher\n\nNow if you're seeing, hearing, or smelling any of those signs, there is a good chance a part (or multiple of them) are damaged, defective, or broken. Replacing a part in your dishwasher, however, is quite simple and will only require some tools, dedicated DIY time, and step-by-step guides to show you exactly how to fix your dishwasher.\n\nHow to Replace a Damaged or Torn Door Gasket in a GE Dishwasher\n\nThe easiest part to replace in your dishwasher that could be causing a leak is the door gasket. The gasket for your GE dishwasher is the rubber material that surrounds the door frame that's intended to seal the interior of the dishwasher cabinet from the inside of your home, and if it's torn or damaged will lead to water leaking. This is one of the most common causes of dishwashers leaking, and will result in you finding water at the bottom of the front of your dishwasher, during or after a cycle. If you notice your dishwasher is leaking and you have a suspicion that a damaged gasket is causing it, you can find an OEM dishwasher door gaskets for your GE model, and then read the following guide to assist you in replacing it.\n\n\n\nOpen and lower the door for your dishwasher.\nInspect the gasket seal around the perimeter of the dishwasher door. If you notice any rips, tears, holes, or any sort of damage, it will need to be removed and replaced.\nPull the old door gasket out from the dishwasher's door frame and dispose of it.\nWith the new gasket in hand, carefully push it into place around the perimeter of the dishwasher door frame.\nNow run a quick washing cycle and monitor for any leaks.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Clogged Filter in a GE Dishwasher\nThe filter in your dishwasher, like any other appliance, is there to collect food debris that would otherwise cause issues later on in the draining process. Water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher after it's finished its washing cycle is a good indication that the filter is clogged, and that could become a leak if not cleaned or replaced. But if you've never changed your GE dishwasher filter and you're now noticing a leak at the bottom or front of it, there's an even greater chance that the filter is causing the leak. Lucky for you, a filter is an incredibly easy part to replace (or clean), and we'll show you precisely how to do it.\n\n\nTurn off the power to your dishwasher.\nOpen your dishwasher door and locate the filter housing at the bottom of the cabinet.\nRemove the lower spray arm.\nTwist to remove the old filter. If there's a securing latch, you may need to disengage it before you can remove the filter.\nClean the current filter by soaking it for a few minutes, and then washing it by hand with soap. But if there's significant damage to it, replace it with a new filter.\nInstall the new filter by twisting it into place.\nReinstall the lower spray arm.\nClose the dishwasher door and run a quick cycle to test the new filter.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Broken Water Inlet Valve in a GE Dishwasher\nA water inlet valve is an electrically controlled valve that is used to regulate and control the water flowing into it, as well as just acting as a gateway for the dishwasher's water supply itself. A broken or shorted water inlet valve will cause leaks in your dishwasher, because it has limited or no control over the flow of water entering it. And since inlet valves are normally located near the bottom of the appliance, it's safe to say that it would be the cause if there's a substantial amount of water around the valve, or underneath near the rear when your dishwasher's off. An easy way to test if the inlet valve is bad, is by opening the door of the dishwasher while it's running – if the water is running, the valve is defective. If your GE dishwasher's inlet valve needs to be replaced, this step-by-step guide will show you exactly how to do that.\n\n\nFirst, turn off the power and water to the dishwasher, and ensure there is no water on the floor near your appliance.\nUnthread and disconnect any screws securing the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nLocate the water inlet valve and disconnect the water supply line from it. This may require a wrench to do.\nDe-clamp the drain and fill hose underneath your sink, then unthread any securing screws to the dishwasher.\nUnthread and disconnect the wires in the junction box before continuing, if necessary.\nPull your dishwasher into an open area and rotate it onto its back.\nInspect the valve for any signs of damage, breaks or leaks.\n(Optional) Use a multimeter to test whether the solenoid (part that opens and closes it) has continuity, or whether it's bad.\nUnscrew and disconnect the valve and its wire harness to remove it.\nInstall the new inlet valve by securing it with screws and connecting the wire harness.\nRotate the dishwasher back upright and push it back into place.\nConnect the water supply line to the valve, and clamp the hoses back into place.\nIf the junction box was disconnected previously, reconnect all of the wires.\nPlug your dishwasher back in and run short washing cycles and monitor it for leaks.\n\n\nHow to Replace the Float and Float Switch in a GE Dishwasher\n\nThe float and float switch, also known as a flood switch, in a GE dishwasher are necessary for detecting and managing the level of water inside the dishwasher during the washing cycle by turning the drain pump on and off. The float will rise and lower depending on the level of water in the dishwasher, but if it gets stuck in either the 'on' or 'off' position (up or down), the pump will either stay on indefinitely or not turn on at all – which is where a leak would arise. So if your GE dishwasher float switch is defective or broken, and you've got a leak underneath your dishwasher, not only do we have the parts you need, we'll tell you how to replace it, too!\n\n\nFirst, disconnect power to the dishwasher by unplugging it from the wall outlet, turn off the water supply, and remove the racks within the interior of the dishwasher.\nRemove the lower spray arm.\nRemove any filters from the bottom of the dishwasher to gain access to the float switch.\nYou may need a screwdriver to unthread and disconnect certain panels within the dishwasher assembly.\nOnce the float switch is accessible, carefully pull it out and disconnect any wires attached to it.\nNow, you can completely remove the float switch and test it with a multimeter if you'd like.\nTo install the new float switch, connect the wire harness to it and install it within the dishwasher.\nReconnect any panels necessary and secure them properly.\nReseat the filters and the spray arms, as well as replacing the racks within the dishwasher.\nRun a quick cycle within the dishwasher and monitor for any leaks.\n\n\nHow to Change a Pump in a GE Dishwasher\n\nThe pump in any dishwasher is simply used to circulate and drain water during its washing cycle, and without it working properly or if it's damaged, it will cause excessive water to build up and/or simply leak. An easy way to detect if your drain pump is out of commission is to see if it actually runs during the drain cycle. If it simply hums quietly when it should be draining, it needs to be replaced. However, if it runs and you're still noticing water left in the dishwasher after the cycle is over, your issue likely lies with the drain hose. So if you're finding water underneath your dishwasher, we have a wide-range of GE dishwasher pumps for you to choose from, and a replacement guide to assist you in replacing it!\n\n\nUnplug and disconnect your dishwasher's power, and turn off and disconnect the water supply.\nOpen your dishwasher's door and remove all of the interior contents, including spray arms and filters.\nUnthread any screws securing the kick plate of your dishwasher.\nUnthread any securing screws holding your dishwasher in place.\nUnscrew and disconnect the wires in the junction box before pulling your dishwasher into an open area, and rotating it on its back.\nTake pictures of any and all wire harnesses for future reference.\nInspect the drain pump and the seals for any damage, cracks, or indication of leaks. Replace it if it's damaged.\nDisconnect all wires and sensors connected to it, then loosen and remove the drain hose.\nIf your model has pump latches, disconnect them.\nRemove the pump assembly from underneath or through the inside of the cabinet.\nNow, carefully remove the drain pump motor.\nInstall the new drain pump, and any seals or clamps necessary.\nUse a small amount of dish soap to lubricate the sump seal, and set it into the dishwasher.\nRotate the dishwasher onto its back and secure the sump assembly.\nReconnect the drain hose, as well as all wires and sensors to the assembly.\nPush your dishwasher back into place, and reconnect any wires.\nReconnect the water line, kick plate, filter, spray arm and dish racks to the dishwasher.\nRun a quick cycle and monitor for leaks.\n\n\nHow to Replace a GE Dishwasher Drain or Fill Hose\n\nA clogged, broken or cracked dishwasher hose can be a leading cause for why your dishwasher is leaking and why you're discovering water at the bottom of it. Fill and drain hoses are meant to transport water in and out of the dishwasher, and if they're cracked, clogged, or simply broken, they will eventually leak and cause damage in your home. But finding the right dishwasher hose is simple enough with our wide range of OEM GE dishwasher parts, and we'll even show you exactly how to replace it!\n\n\nFirst, unplug your dishwasher from the wall outlet and turn off and disconnect the water supply.\nUnthread and remove the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nUnthread and disconnect the wires in the junction box before continuing, if necessary.\nDisconnect the drain hose from the sink, and unthread any screws securing the dishwasher.\nCarefully pull the dishwasher into an open area and rotate the dishwasher onto its back.\nLocate the drain hose assembly in the dishwasher, and carefully disconnect it if it's damaged or cracked.\nInstall the new drain hose, ensuring all connections and clamps are secure.\nRotate the dishwasher back upright and then push the dishwasher back into place to secure it.\nConnect the new drain hose to the sink where the previous connection was.\nReconnect the any junction box wires, as well as the water supply line to the inlet valve.\nSecure the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher, and turn the water supply back on.\nPlug your dishwasher back in, and run a quick wash cycle to monitor for leaks.\n\n\nHow to Prevent Future Leaks in Your GE Dishwasher\n\nIt's important that your GE dishwasher is equipped and in its best condition to ensure that maintenance issues, like leaks, don't happen – or at the very least, not very often. And dishwashers are only as effective at cleaning our dishes as we allow them to be, so these are the most important things you can do to ensure your dishwasher does not leak and gets your dishes clean:\n\n\nUse Correct Detergent: An extremely overlooked aspect of dishwashing is using the right detergent; using the wrong type can cause overflow of water and soap, and result in a nasty leak.\nClean or New Drain Hose: Even though it's a part we mentioned replacing, maintaining a clean drain hose or replacing it when it's clogged or nearing the end of its life cycle will prevent water buildups and leaks.\n\n\nNow that you hopefully have your dishwasher back in order, you're already on the road  to getting clean dishes without the worry of flooding your home!

A Maytag dryer that won't start is usually caused by a bad push-to-start or door switch, door latch, thermal fuse, belt, or control board, and can be fixed relatively quickly with only a few tools!\n\nWhy Your Maytag Dryer Won't Start\nNot every Maytag dryer has the same starting issues, so laying out all of the most frequently asked questions for you to figure out where to start gives you the best chance of fixing your dryer's issue as soon as possible, and getting your wet clothes dry.\n\nWhy won't my Maytag dryer start, even with power?\nA Maytag dryer not starting when you push its start button can be a sign that the start button is bad and in need of replacing, but the following list of parts may also be bad or faulty, and not only causing your dryer starting issues, but are also in need of replacing:\nBad Push-to-Start Switch\nBad Door Switch\nBroken Door Latch\nBlown or Faulty Thermal Fuse\nBroken Dryer Belt\nFaulty or Bad Control Board\n\n\nWhy is nothing happening when I push my Maytag dryer's start button?\nIf your Maytag dryer isn't starting after selecting the cycle and pressing the start button, there's usually an underlying issue at hand with the start button itself or another part. For example, if the start button is broken or bad it won't tell the control board to start the drying cycle, and your dryer will not start.\n\nWhy won't my Maytag dryer start, but it clicks?\nA clicking sound coming from your dryer when it won't start indicates a bad or faulty thermostat within the dryer. The 'clicking' noise can be many things, but is normally the thermostat opening and closing, which is usually an indication that it needs to be replaced.\n\nHow do I reset my Maytag dryer?\nMany Maytag dryer models do not have a dedicated reset button like other manufacturers, however, an easy way to reset your Maytag dryer, or any appliance for that matter, is to unplug it. Once you've unplugged it, let it sit for 5-10 minutes before plugging it in again and starting a dryer cycle. Doing this performs a hard reset, and if your dryer doesn't work after performing one, it means your issue lies with it parts.\n\nHow to Fix a Maytag Dryer That Won't Start\nIf resetting your Maytag dryer didn't work, your dryer issues are definitely with the parts of the dryer itself. As mentioned above, this may be a simple push-to-start switch, or could be replacing the entire dryer belt. In any case, we have the guide you need to fix your Maytag dryer today!\n\nHow to Replace a Maytag Dryer Start Button if it Won't Start\nThe central place to start with any sort of dryer starting issue is its start button - whether it's the button itself or the switch that actually communicates with the control board, one is clearly not working and needs to be replaced with an OEM Maytag dryer start button switch.\n\n\n\nFirst, disconnect your dryer's power cord from its wall outlet.\nThen locate your dryer's push-to-start button.\nPull your dryer away from the wall.\nUsing a Philips-head screwdriver, unthread and disconnect the back panel of the dryer.\nTake note of any wires for future installation reference.\nRemove the button and then the wire harness from the current switch.\nUse a screwdriver to dislodge the current switch and remove it from its installation location.\nFrom here, you can use a multimeter to test the switch for continuity, or you can replace it outright.\nTo install the new switch, push it into place and rotate it if necessary to secure it.\nInstall the wire harness into the new switch, and replace the back cover of the dryer.\nPlug your dryer back into the wall outlet, and attempt to run a short test cycle. If the dryer does not start, the push-to-start switch is not the central issue.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Maytag Dryer Door Switch if it Won’t Start\nIf the push-to-start switch in your Maytag dryer is not the source of your dryer's starting issues, the door switch can certainly lend itself to many starting issues. A bad door switch will cause the control board not to recognize when the door has been shut so it can properly start. However, replacing a dryer door switch is easy with a few tools and the right OEM dryer door switch for your Maytag dryer model!\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dryer from its wall outlet.\nDepending on your dryer model, you will need to remove the top-mounted lint screen.\nOpen your dryer door and locate its door switch.\nUse a putty knife and screwdriver to dislodge the top panel of the dryer.\nLocate the door switch on the side of the dryer, and use a screwdriver to disconnect its wire harness.\nUse your screwdriver to unthread the mounting bracket of the switch from the front of the dryer.\nRemove the old switch, and now you can test it with a multimeter to test for continuity. If it shows signs of continuity, it is not causing the starting issues.\nWith the new or existing switch, install it into the appropriate wire harness and mounting bracket.\nReconnect the top of the dryer and thread all necessary screws back into the dryer.\nInstall the lint-screen back into the dryer.\nPlug your dryer back in and run a short cycle. If it does not start, the door switch is not causing the starting problems.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Maytag Dryer Door Latch if it Won’t Start\nIf your dryer won't start, it may be the result a broken door latch not communicating to the control board that the door is closed. A dryer's door latch can break if the door is closed too aggressively, or simply over time due to wear and tear. However, it can also be easily replaced with a few tools, an OEM door latch made for your Maytag dryer model, and the guide to show you how to replace it!\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dryer from the wall outlet.\nOpen the dryer door and locate the door latch.\nInspect the door latch for any damage or broken pieces. If you notice either of those, it will need to be replaced.\nTo replace the dryer door latch, use a screwdriver to gain access to the latch itself; this may involve dislodging a plastic panel within the frame. This may also require you to use your screwdriver to unthread certain pieces, which will need to be rethreaded later.\nOnce any plastic panels are removed, use a screwdriver to remove the old door latch and install the new one.\nEnsure the new door latch is secure and reinstall any plastic panel covers.\nPlace clothes in the dryer and attempt to start a dryer load. If the dryer doesn't start, the door latch is not causing the starting problems.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Maytag Dryer Thermal Fuse if it Won’t Start\nThermal fuses are designed to cut off power to the heating element and dryer as a whole if the internal temperature exceeds the safety limit. If your Maytag dryer isn't starting, it very well could be a case of a thermal fuse that's been activated or potentially defective. But what's important is you can replace a thermal fuse easily with a few tools, a new OEM thermal fuse for your Maytag dryer model, and a step-by-step guide to show you the whole process.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dryer from its wall outlet. For this repair, it's important you wear protective gloves.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread and remove the back panel of the dryer.\nLocate the thermal fuse within the dryer cabinet. This may be near the exhaust duct or the blower housing, both of which will likely be near the bottom rear of the cabinet.\nDisconnect the wire harness connected to the thermal fuse, and now you can use a multimeter to test it for continuity or just replace it. If it shows signs of continuity, move on to the next part. But if it does not show continuity, you will need to replace it.\nUnthread and remove the old thermal fuse and install the new one in its place.\nConnect the necessary wire harness and secure the new fuse.\nReplace the back panel cover of your dryer, and connect the plug to your wall outlet.\nAttempt to run a cycle in the dryer, and if it doesn't start, it is not the cause of your problems.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Maytag Dryer Belt if it Won’t Start\nThe dryer belt is arguably the most important part of a dryer, since it is what rotates the drum inside the cabinet. If the belt is broken or damaged, the dryer drum will stop rotating and may even cause the dryer not to start, and will need to be replaced. All you need to replace a Maytag dryer belt are a few tools, a new OEM belt made for your Maytag dryer model, and the following guide to show you how to replace it.\n\n\n\nFirst, disconnect your dryer from the wall outlet.\nIf your dryer has a top-mounted lint screen, remove it.\nUse a putty knife and/or screwdriver to disconnect the top panel of the dryer.\nDisconnect any wire harnesses within the top of the dryer cabinet. Make sure to take pictures of any wires for future installation reference.\nUse your screwdriver to unthread and disconnect the dryer's front panel, and then remove it. Depending your model, you may also need to remove wire harnesses in the door, as well as removing the door itself.\nNow, locate the dryer drum belt and investigate it for any damage or breaks. If it is still in good working condition, you can reassemble your dryer.\nIf your dryer belt is broken or damaged, it's important that you replace it.\nLocate the idler pulley underneath the dryer drum and carefully disconnect the belt from it.\nLift the dryer drum and remove the old belt.\nInstall the new belt underneath the drum and carefully into the idler pulley.\nInstall the dryer's front panel, as well as any wire harness originally connected to it, as well as a the door if that was removed.\nReinstall any necessary wire harnesses at the top portion of the dryer cabinet.\nInstall the top portion of the dryer, and ensure it is secured with the appropriate screws.\nInstall the lint screen and any screws at the top of the dryer if applicable.\nConnect your dryer to the wall outlet and start a new cycle. If it still does not start, you need to replace the control board.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Maytag Dryer Control Board if it Won’t Start\nIf you're having any sort of starting issue with your dryer, and no other parts are responsible, the control board is usually the last part to be replaced considering it's the brains of your dryer. If your Maytag dryer's control board is not working properly and is bad or shorted, it needs to be replaced immediately. Everything you would need to replace a Maytag dryer's control board are a new OEM control board itself, as well as a few tools, and a handy guide!\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dryer from its wall outlet.\nDepending on your dryer model, you may have a control board on the top or front of your cabinet. Use a screwdriver to remove the back panel of the dryer if it is a top-mounted model, and remove the top panel if it's a front-mounted model.\nLocate the control board take any photos of the wires and their connections for future reference.\nDisconnect the wire harnesses connected to the control board. Now you can use a multimeter to test the control board for any shorts or defects. Use your model's user manual to verify the correct specifications for continuity and whether it needs to be replaced.\nConnect the wire harnesses from your dryer to the new board.\nInstall the new control board within your dryer.\nReinstall the top and/or back panel of your dryer, and ensure all of the dryer's screw connections are secure.\nYou can now run a test cycle on your dryer to ensure all components are working properly.\n\n\n\nAt this point, your dryer should be working well, and your clothes are hopefully getting drier as you're reading this!

After all, water filters are used to remove any chemicals or minerals that would be unhealthy to drink, like chlorine, VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and many more. Which is why we're going to show you exactly how to replace an LG refrigerator's water filter, and answer some popular questions along the way.\n\nHow to Replace the Different Types of LG Refrigerator Water Filters\nAlthough there are quite a few different models and types of LG refrigerators, they all borrow from a shared pool of water filters. Speaking of, you can find the water filter for your LG refrigerator in PartSelect's water filter finder! Each of these filter types all serve the same purpose, in filtering out harsh chemicals, contaminants, and unpleasant tasting minerals, but they all require different ways of removing and installing. Before replacing any water filter, ensure your water line supply is shut and turned off.\n\nInline Water Filter\nInline water filters are installed outside of your refrigerator and are designed to allow the water line to flow inline through it, on its way to the refrigerator. The most common LG refrigerators that use inline water filters are top freezer models.\n\n\nFor this replacement, you will require a bucket and a towel.\nLocate an inline water filter behind the fridge. It is normally mounted to the wall or the fridge itself.\nYour filter will have two water lines going into each end of the filter, with a grommet securing each tube. Carefully remove the tubes from each end.\nTake the new filter and plug the water supply line into one end.\nNow turn your water supply on and flush 2.5 gallons of water through the filter to flush and prime it. Once finished, turn off the water supply.\nThen, install the fridge's water line into the filter.\nTo ensure the filter is installed correctly, if you pull slightly on each line, the line should stay inside the filter.\nInstall the filter to your wall or refrigerator mount, and turn on the water supply.\n\n\n\nTwist to Remove Water Filter\nTwist to remove water filters are normally located in the top left or top right portion of your French 3 or 4 door, side-by-side, or top freezer refrigerator, or in its door.\n\n\nPull the tray of the water filter out if applicable, and allow the filter to swing out or down.\nGrab the filter and turn it counterclockwise until it disconnects and comes out of the filter housing.\nTake the new filter and place it in the filter housing, then rotate it clockwise until it's secure.\nIf your filter has a housing or tray, push it into place and close the housing.\nNow, turn on the water supply to the refrigerator and dispense 2.5 gallons of water to flush and prime the filter.\n\n\n\nPull Down Water Filter\nIf your refrigerator has a pull down water filter, you will normally locate it in French 3 or 4 door, or side-by-side models of refrigerators.\n\n\nLocate the water filter in the top right or top left of the refrigerator cabinet.\nOpen the water filter tray, and the water filter should swing out.\nPull the water filter down carefully and it should simply come out.\nWith your new water filter in hand, push it into the filter housing, and swing it upwards towards the fridge ceiling.\nClose the water filter tray, and turn on the water supply.\nFlush 2.5 gallons of water through the water dispenser to get the filter primed and ready to be used.\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Water Filters\nWhen replacing the water filter in your LG refrigerator, there are some common misconceptions and things that are popularly misunderstood - and we're hoping that these frequently asked questions will clear up anything you're curious about!\n\nAre generic water filters OK to use?\nGeneric and non-OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) filters are not suitable for use for most appliances and equipment, especially not refrigerators. OEM water filters require much less maintenance, are designed to work specifically with your refrigerator model, and because they are made and supplied directly from the original manufacturer, and thus go through the same quality testing, they also typically last much longer.\n\nHow often do I need to change my LG refrigerator's water filter?\nYou need to replace your LG refrigerator's water filter once every 6 months, or as needed. It's important to look for taste differences in the water, an indicator that will light around the time the filter needs to be replaced, or a significantly lower level of water pressure from the dispenser.\n\nCan you replace an LG refrigerator water filter without turning off water?\nWhen replacing the water filter for your LG refrigerator, it's important to disengage and turn off the water line to ensure a large amount of excess water does not come out from the water filter port when replacing it.\n\nHow do I reset my LG refrigerator after installing a new water filter?\nOnce your water filter for your LG refrigerator has been replaced with a new one, you can easily reset the water filter light indicator by holding the 'Reset Filter' button for 3-5 seconds, until the light turns off.\n\nNow that you've replaced the water filter in your LG refrigerator, you're able to enjoy tasty and contaminant-free water! Remember that water filters need to replaced on a regular basis, and at the very most should be replaced after 6-8 months of regular use. However, if you use your refrigerator's built-in water dispenser more or less often than average, you may be looking at a different lifespan for your new filter.\n\nTo read other guides and articles on home improvement and DIY appliance repair, make sure to check out the PartSelect blog!

If it smells like rotten eggs, there is likely a dead animal stuck in the ductwork, which you will need to remove. If the unit smells musty, the air filters are either clogged or need to be replaced. Smelling exhaust fumes is a sign that the circuit or wiring is burnt, while smelling smoke indicates that the evaporator coils need to be cleaned. If the air conditioner smells like skunk spray or sulfur this is an indication of a gas leakage and you will need to turn off the gas and call your service provider immediately. Whether you have a window or portable air conditioner, you can use this guide to learn practical tips and techniques for identifying, addressing, and preventing these common air conditioner smells.  \n\nAir Conditioner Smells like Mold or Mildew\nIf your air conditioner smells like mold it is likely due to moisture buildup within the unit, which creates an ideal environment for mold and mildew growth. As warm air passes over the evaporator coil, moisture in the air condenses on the cold coil and forms water droplets. This water then drips down into a drain pan located beneath the evaporator coil. To get rid of this smell you will need to thoroughly clean the drain pan, which is the part responsible for holding water produced by the AC until is drained out. If you own a portable air conditioner, you will typically need to empty the drain pan manually each time it reaches capacity in order to keep it clean and prevent the growth of mold and bacteria.\n\nHow to Clean the Air Conditioner Drain Pan\n\nBefore starting any maintenance on your air conditioner disconnect the power supply for your safety.\nRemove the access panel or front cover of the AC to access the drain pan which is typically found beneath the evaporator coil.\nIf there's standing water in the drain pan, use towels to remove it. Be careful not to spill water onto electrical components.\nMix a solution of warm water and mild detergent or dish soap in a bucket. Alternatively, you can use a mixture of water and vinegar for natural disinfecting properties.\nUse a soft brush or sponge to gently scrub the drain pan until you have removed all traces of contaminants. \nRinse it with clean water to remove any remaining soap or debris.\nFor added disinfection, you can spray the drain pan with a mixture of water and bleach.\nAllow the bleach solution to sit for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly with clean water.\nUse a clean towel or allow the drain pan to air dry completely before reinstalling it.\nOnce the drain pan is clean and dry, reassemble the air conditioner and reconnect the power supply.\n\n\nAir Conditioner Smells like Socks or Dirty Feet\nAn unpleasant odor that smells like dirty socks or feet is caused by stagnant water in the drain pan. Window air conditioners have a condensate line, which is a pipe or tube that is responsible for removing excess moisture, or condensate, from the air conditioner. It carries water out of the drain pan and disposes of it outside the home. A clogged condensate drain line will be unable to carry out this function leading to water collecting in the pan and not draining out. A clogged condensate line may also cause water in the drain pan to overflow. This can result in water damage to the air conditioner and surrounding areas, therefore, it is important to address the problem as soon as possible.\n \nHow to Clear a Blocked Condensate Line\n\nTurn off the power to the air conditioning system before beginning any repairs.\nLocate the condensate line which typically runs from the air conditioner's indoor unit to the outside of your home. It may also connect to a drain or a condensate pump.\nInspect the condensate line for any visible signs of blockage or bends which may restrict the flow of water.\nYou can use your hands, a brush, or a small plumbing snake to clear the blockage.\nOnce the line is clear, you can clean it by flushing it with a mixture of equal parts vinegar and water.\nOnce you've cleared the blockage, turn on the air conditioner and monitor the condensate line for proper drainage. You should see water flowing freely from the line to the drain or outside of your home.\n\n\nAir Conditioner Smells Musty\nA musty air conditioner smell is one of the most common unpleasant smells that many owners experience. It is typically caused by dirty air filters. The air filter in both window and portable units is responsible for trapping dust, and other contaminants from entering the air conditioner to keep the air fresh and protect various internal components in your unit from damage. Over time it is common for the air filters to accumulate and become obstructed by dust and debris. It is recommended to regularly clean them to allow fresh air to circulate properly and keep the unit running efficiently.\n\nHow to Clean the Air Conditioner Air Filters\n\nBegin by disconnecting the air conditioner from the power supply.\nRemove the grille or cover on the unit to access the filters. \nDepending on your air conditioner you may be able to simply pull out the filter or you may first need to remove the air filter cover if one is present.\nIf the filters are damaged or no longer in good condition, you will likely need to replace the air filter to fix your air conditioner.\nRinse the filter under warm water to clear off any dirt or debris. Avoid using hot water, as this can damage the filter material. You can also use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently remove the dust from the filters.\nIf the filters are particularly dirty, you can use a mild detergent solution to help remove stubborn stains or buildup. \nAfter cleaning, allow the filters to air dry completely before reinstalling them in the air conditioner. Ensure they are thoroughly dry to prevent mold or mildew growth.\nOnce the filters are dry, carefully slide them back into place or reattach them to the unit, ensuring they are positioned correctly and securely.\nRestore power to the air conditioner and check that it is running properly.\nTo maintain optimal performance, it's recommended to clean or replace air conditioner filters every 1 to 3 months, depending on usage and environmental factors.\n\n\nAir Conditioner Smells like Rotten Eggs\nIf you smell rotten eggs coming from your air conditioner, this is an indication that there may be a dead animal inside the ductwork in your home. Unfortunately, it is common for small animals such as birds and rodents to get trapped inside the ducts. However, even if you have a ductless air conditioner, smaller animals such as lizards may still find their way inside the unit and become trapped there. You will need to inspect and remove any foreign materials inside the unit to get rid of the smell. \n\nHow to Remove a Dead Animal From Ducts\n\nPut on gloves, a mask, and safety glasses to protect yourself from any potential contaminants or pathogens associated with handling dead animals.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the screws securing the vent cover or access panel.\nInspect the ductwork for any obstructions or a dead animal. If you are sure there is an animal but you are unable to reach it, you should call in a professional pest removal company.\nIf you can reach the animal, carefully pull it from the ductwork using gloved hands or a pair of tongs. Be careful not to touch the carcass with your bare hands as this may pose a health risk.\nPlace the carcass in a sealed plastic bag or container and dispose of it at an approved waste disposal site. \nThoroughly clean and disinfect the area of the ductwork where you found the dead animal. You can use a mixture of bleach and water to sanitize the area and remove any remaining odor.\n\n \nAir Conditioner Smells like Smoke\nIf you smoke in your home or near the outdoor unit, then eventually your air conditioner will begin to smell like stale cigarette smoke. This is because certain components in your air conditioner, such as the evaporator coil, absorb the odor from the smoke and then circulate it through the vents whenever you are using the air conditioner. To avoid the smell of smoke it is best to clean the evaporator coil and also avoid smoking in or near your home.\n\nHow to Clean the Evaporator Coil\n\nRemove the cover or front panel of the air conditioner to access the evaporator coil.\nIf the evaporator coil is covered by an access panel, use a screwdriver to remove it as well.\nUse a soft-bristled brush or a coil cleaning brush to gently remove dirt and debris from the coil fins. Be careful to avoid bending or damaging the fins, as this can restrict airflow and reduce system efficiency.\nApply coil cleaner to the evaporator coil according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAllow the coil cleaner to sit on the coils for the recommended time as this allows the cleaner to penetrate and loosen stubborn dirt and debris.\nRinse the evaporator coil thoroughly with clean water.\nOnce the coil is dry, reassemble the access panel and front cover of the air conditioner and secure it in place. \nTurn the power back on to your air conditioning system and test it to ensure proper operation.\n\n\n Air Conditioner Smells like Skunk or Gas\nIf your air conditioner smells like skunk or sulfur, this is a sign of a potentially dangerous situation in your home that requires immediate attention. This smell is usually a sign of a gas leakage, specifically one known as methyl mercaptan. If you detect this smell, promptly turn off the gas supply to your home, leave the area, and contact your gas provider immediately.\n\nAir Conditioner Smells like Exhaust Fumes\nAn air conditioner that smells like exhaust fumes or like something is burning is typically caused by a burnt circuit board or wiring. If you suspect there are electrical issues in the air conditioner, it is essential to have the system inspected by a qualified technician to prevent safety hazards.\nThis smell may also be caused by leaking refrigerant. Refrigerant is a cooling agent that helps to keep your air conditioner running efficiently. Over time the refrigerant can corrode due to exposure to moisture, or chemicals, or it may become damaged or loose. If the refrigerant line is damaged or faulty, it may cause the refrigerant to leak out. It is best to call a professional technician to address this issue promptly as it can be hazardous to your health. \n \nUnderstanding the causes behind the odors coming from your air conditioner is the first step towards effectively eliminating them and restoring a fresh, comfortable indoor environment. If you follow the steps laid out in this article, you will be well-equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to conquer air conditioner smells once and for all.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

In this article, we'll walk you through troubleshooting and fixing these common problems step by step.\n\nSigns Your Whirlpool Washer Isn't Spinning Properly\nDealing with a Whirlpool washer that refuses to spin can be a real head-scratcher. You may notice these warning signs when this happens:\n\nWater Not Draining: If you find water lingering in the drum after a wash cycle, it's a strong indication that your washer's draining system isn't functioning correctly.\nClothes Still Soaking Wet: When your freshly washed laundry comes out of your washer dripping wet, it may be linked to an imbalanced load which prevented your washer from wringing out excess water.\nHeavier Loads Aren't Cleaning: If you find that your washer isn't cleaning larger loads properly, it could be because you're using the wrong cycle or your washer isn't sitting level.\nUnusual Noises: Grinding, thumping, or squealing noises during operation can indicate a variety of mechanical issues. For instance, a squealing noise could point to belt problems and clicking might indicate an issue with your washer's lid switch or door lock.\nSilent Spin Cycle: On the other hand, an unusually quiet spin cycle could be due to a malfunctioning lid switch.\n\n\nTroubleshooting and Fixing a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Spin\nBased on the symptoms you are observing on your non-spinning washer, various underlying reasons may be at play:\n\nYour Whirlpool Washer Won’t Empty or Spin: It can be frustrating when your washer seems stuck and there's still water inside after a cycle. To tackle this, you’ll need to check the drain hose of your washer to make sure it's not twisted, blocked, or bent in a way that stops the water from getting out.\nYour Whirlpool Washer Drains but Won’t Spin: If your washer is good at getting rid of water but doesn't want to spin, there are two things to check. Look at the lid switch or door latch. If it's engaging, your washer thinks it's not safe to spin. Another possibility is a broken or displaced belt inside the machine.\nYour Whirlpool Washer Does Not Spin at Full Speed:  If your washer is spinning slowly or stuttering, it's probably because of heavy or lopsided laundry loads. This can also make your washer move forward during a wash.\n\n\nThings to Check on a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Spin\nNow that you know the suspects as to why your washer isn’t spinning, it's time to perform some quick troubleshooting. Start by examining these:\n\nIs Your Washer Overloaded?\nBegin by checking if you've overloaded your washer. Jamming too many clothes inside can hinder the spinning process. To fix this, simply remove some items and try the cycle again.\n\nAre You Selecting the Right Cycle?\nUsing the correct cycle setting also helps the washer adapt to the specific demands of the load, including the spinning process. For example, opt for \"bulky\" when washing bedding or blankets.\n\nIs Your Washer Level?\nA balanced washer is crucial for effective spinning. An unlevel washer, with one or more feet not resting evenly on the ground, can lead to spinning problems. Use a level to check the appliance's balance and adjust the legs until the washer sits perfectly horizontal.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Lid Switch on a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Spin\nThe lid switch in a top load Whirlpool washer is a safety feature that stops the machine from spinning when the lid is open. This small plastic component can be found either under the lid or on the top of the machine. You can manually activate it by gently pushing the tip of a screwdriver into it, to simulate the lid being closed. You should hear a distinct click from the switch whenever you close the lid shut. If you don't hear this click, the switch might need replacement. Follow these steps to inspect and test the lid switch:\n\nBegin by disconnecting your washer from the power source.\nLocate the lid switch, typically situated in the top right corner where the lid would close. On certain models, you might need to remove the top control panel or even the entire washer cabinet to access the lid switch.\nTake out the screws holding the lid switch in place.\nCarefully pull the lid switch from its position. The lid switch may still be attached due to wiring and retaining clips. Disconnect and remove these components.\nTo test the lid switch, use a multimeter to check for continuity. If the lid is closed (or you simulate it as closed), the multimeter should display continuity, often indicated by a beep or a reading close to zero ohms. A reading in this range confirms that the switch is functioning correctly. If there's no continuity, it's time to replace the lid switch.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Door Latch on a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Spin\nLike the lid switch on top load washers, the latch ensures the door on front load machines is securely locked during operation. It is usually behind the front panel of the washer, near the door frame. It consists of a latch assembly with a locking mechanism that engages with the door strike. If the door is not properly latched, the washer will not operate. This means that if the latch is defective, the washer will not spin. To access and check the door latch:\n\nUnplug the washer or turn off the breaker to ensure safety.\nOpen the washer door. You might need to remove the front panel or access panel to reach the latch mechanism.\nRemove the screws holding the latch assembly in place and lift it off its mounting bracket.\nDisconnect the wires attached to the door latch assembly, and remove it from the washer. Some models may have a shield over the connectors that can be removed with a flathead screwdriver.\nTest the door latch with a multimeter by first setting it to the continuity setting.\nLook at the connector to identify the terminal pins for the door latch. Typically, there will be two or three pins that you'll be testing for continuity.\nTouch the multimeter probes to the terminal pins on the door latch connector. You may need to refer to your owner's manual to know which pins to test. If testing a two-pin latch, place one probe on each pin. If there are more than two pins, you'll need to consult your washer's wiring diagram to know which pins to test for continuity.\nIf there is no continuity, the latch is defective and needs to be replaced.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drive Belt on a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Spin\nThe drive belt in a Whirlpool washer connects the motor to the drum, allowing it to spin. If the belt is worn, stretched, or broken, the drum won't spin properly. Signs of a failing belt include a squealing noise during operation or visible wear on the belt itself.\n\nUnplug the washer from the power source, turn off the water supply to the washer, and disconnect the hoses to provide easier access to the rear washer panel.\nRemove the back panel of the washer.\nCheck that the drive belt is secure and not frayed.\nIf you decide to replace the drive belt, turn the tub drive pulley, and the belt should fall off.\nTo install a new drive belt, put one end of the new belt around the motor pulley and place the other end on the tub drive pulley. Rotate the tub drive pulley to secure the new drive belt.\nWith the new drive belt fitted, reassemble the washer.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drain Hose on a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Spin\nA kinked drain hose disrupts the flow of water, preventing your Whirlpool Washer from properly expelling from the washer's drum and unable to move into the spin cycle. To troubleshoot and install the hose correctly:\n\nStart by inspecting the drain hose to identify any kinks or bends that might be obstructing water flow.\nIf you spot a kink in the drain hose, loosen the clamp that holds it in place at the washer's connection point. Carefully remove the kinked hose from the washer.\nReplace the kinked hose with a new one. Ensure that the new drain hose is securely attached to your washer, and tighten the clamp to hold it firmly in place. To further prevent kinks, straighten the drain hose as much as possible.\nIf needed, use a U-shaped drain hose form (often included with the washer or available separately) to maintain the shape and position of the hose.\nWhile troubleshooting the drain hose, also examine the drainpipe or utility sink where the hose expels the water. Make sure there are no blockages or clogs that could impede water drainage.\n\n\nIf you've gone through these troubleshooting steps and your Whirlpool washer still refuses to spin, it may be time to seek professional assistance. An experienced technician can diagnose and fix more complex issues, so that your washer can get back to its spinning best.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Whether you are the proud owner of a brand-new Samsung dryer or you're trying to troubleshoot your dryer, understanding the meaning behind each symbol will help you make informed decisions and get the most out of your appliance. Each symbol represents a specific function or setting designed to optimize drying performance while preserving the integrity of your clothes. \n\nCommon Samsung Dryer Symbols \nNavigate through this list of Samsung dryer symbols to find out what each one means, how to activate various features, and how to troubleshoot any potential problems.\n\nSamsung Dryer Sensor Dry\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol indicates that the Sensor Dry cycle is in progress. The Sensor Dry feature detects the moisture levels of the clothes inside the dryer. It will automatically adjust the time needed to complete the drying cycle based on the level of dryness you selected. Therefore, it is completely normal to notice the dryer time increase. The Sensor Dry feature helps to make the dryer more energy efficient and it prevents your clothes from heat damage. It is best to use this feature when you have an average to large laundry size. This is because there needs to be enough clothing items moving past the moisture sensor for the dryer to accurately detect the overall moisture levels. If the clothes are too few, then the dryer may be unable to detect the correct moisture levels and leave you with damp clothes at the end of the cycle.  \n\nSamsung Dryer Child Lock\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol is a sign that the Child Lock feature on your Samsung dryer is activated. It disables all the dryer buttons except for the Power button and the control knob. To activate the Child Lock feature, press and hold the two buttons on your control panel that have the “Child Lock” label underneath them, until the symbol lights up. To deactivate the Child Lock feature, simply press and hold the two buttons again until the symbol light switches off. \n\nSamsung Dryer Delay Start\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol indicates that the Delay Start is activated. The Delay Start is used when you select a cycle but schedule it to begin at a later time. This feature allows you to select the most convenient time for your laundry to be done, for example, you can select a cycle to start while you are at work or running errands. To turn the Delay Start off, press and hold the buttons labeled “Time” and “Drying Level” at the same time for at least 3 seconds. \n\nSamsung Dryer Filter Reminder\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol is the Filter Reminder. It lights up at the end of every cycle as a reminder to clean the dryer lint filter. It is recommended to clean the filter after each load to prevent lint from building up in the dryer vents, which restricts airflow in the dryer and reduces the heating capabilities of your dryer. On some Samsung dryer models, the Filter Reminder Icon will flash on and off in quick succession to draw your attention to it. If this icon does not switch off or it stays on for extended periods, it may be a sign that there is a control board error.  \n\nSamsung Dryer Time Remaining\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThis hourglass symbol indicates that the dryer is running on a timed cycle. The timed dry allows you to run a cycle and customize the length of the time that the cycle will run. The display panel will also show a series of numbers that indicate how much time is remaining until the end of the cycle. \n\nSamsung Dryer Signal Off\nSaveEmbed Image\nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol shows that the sounds that are played at the end of a cycle are turned off. This feature is useful if you do not want to be disturbed by the chiming sounds made by your dryer. To turn it on or off, simply press and hold the “Drum Light” button for 3 seconds. Alternatively, you can press and hold the “Options” button on your dryer and use the Navigation selector to select “Alarm”. Click “OK” and select the “Off” option. To turn the sound back on, simply follow these steps and select the “On” option. Depending on your Samsung dryer model, either of these two signs may be displayed, however they both indicate the same thing. \n\nSamsung Dryer Mixed Load Bell\nSaveEmbed Image\nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol represents the Mixed Load Bell. When you are running a load that contains a mix of heavy and light items, this feature will notify you when the load reaches 80% dryness. It is recommended to pause the cycle and remove the lighter/dry items before continuing with the rest of the load. However, if you do not pause the cycle, the dryer will continue as normal. To turn this feature on, simply hold down the Mixed Load Bell button for 3 seconds.\n\nSamsung Dryer Vent Check\nSaveEmbed Image\nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol indicates that the exhaust vent needs to be cleaned. It is a safety feature that will light up when it detects that the vent is 60% clogged. Once the vent is 80% clogged, the Vent Check symbol will start blinking on and off. A blocked vent could lead to longer drying times, poor heating, and even a fire hazard. To check the vent pipe, simply disconnect it from the back of the dryer and check for any visible obstructions. Use a soft, flexible brush to remove any build-up, or call in a professional if you are unable to clear it yourself.\n\nSamsung Dryer Steam\nSaveEmbed Image\nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol is a sign that the Steam feature in your dryer is active.  This feature works the same way as a traditional clothes steamer, by spraying water on your clothes during the drying cycle to remove odors, and static and to smooth out any wrinkles. You can turn on this feature when you are selecting a drying cycle for your clothes. \n\nSamsung Dryer Smart Care\nSaveEmbed Image\nSource: Samsung Support\nThis icon is displayed when the Smart Care feature is enabled. Smart Care is a diagnostic tool used to find out any potential problems that your dryer may be experiencing. When you select the Smart Care option, a code will be displayed. Enter the code into the Samsung Smart Dryer app to find out what the code means and how to troubleshoot the issue. You can also use your phone camera to quickly scan the code. This feature does not require the use of Wi-Fi.\n\nSamsung Dryer Smart Control\nSaveEmbed Image\nSource: Samsung Support\nThis symbol indicates that the Smart Control feature is activated. It allows you to monitor your dryer remotely. You can use this feature when you are out running errands, or you are at work. Using the SmartThings app, you can check the cycle settings and the time remaining until the end of the cycle. To use the SmartControl feature, open the SmartThings app and click the “Home” option. Select your dryer and look for the information you are interested in.  \n\nSamsung Dryer Wi-Fi\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThis Wi-Fi icon indicates that the dryer is successfully connected to the internet. Wi-Fi connectivity is available on all Samsung Smart Dryers. When the Wi-Fi icon is lit up, you can use the SmartThings app to monitor your dryer remotely or control various cycle settings. You can also receive drying cycle suggestions to optimize your laundry days based on your previous usage history. \n\nSamsung Dryer Cycle Progress\nSaveEmbed Image \nSource: Samsung Support\nThese symbols represent which part of the cycle the dryer is currently on. For example, the dryer may be currently sanitizing the laundry, or it may be on the wrinkle control part. These icons can help you tell how much time is left before the laundry cycle is complete.\n\nCommon Samsung Dryer Error Codes\n\nSamsung Dryer \"do\" Error CodeThis error code indicates that the door of the dryer is not securely closed or the door switch may be malfunctioning. Before beginning any repairs, first try to close the door firmly, as this normally fixes the issues. However, if the problem persists, inspect the door switch area in case something is blocking the door from closing properly, or preventing the switch from detecting that the door is shut, such as lint or built-up residue. Use a soft cloth and rubbing alcohol to clean the area thoroughly.\nIf you have tried to close the door and clean the door switch area and the error code is still displayed then the door switch may be malfunctioning either due to physical damage or an electrical fault. You will need to remove the door switch from the dryer and visually inspect it for visible signs of wear. You can also use a multimeter set to the \"ohms\" setting to check for continuity. If it is faulty, you will need a replacement door switch to fix your Samsung dryer.\n\nSamsung Dryer \"dF\" Error CodeThe dF error code signifies a door circuit failure. This code is typically displayed when the door switch is faulty. Locate the door switch around the dryer door frame and inspect the door switch for any signs of damage or wear. If the switch appears damaged or doesn't click when you press it, it may need to be replaced. Using a multimeter set to continuity to test the switch for electrical failure is also recommended. Sometimes, the issue may be with the wiring connected to the door switch. Make sure the wires are securely connected and not damaged. You will need to replace the wire harness if it is no longer in good working condition.\n\nSamsung Dryer \"Od\" Error CodeThe Od error ode on a Samsung dryer typically indicates that the dryer is taking longer than normal to dry clothes. This could be due to several factors, including:\n\nClogged lint filter: A clogged lint filter restricts the airflow in the dryer and reduces the dryer's heating abilities, leading to longer drying times. It is recommended to clean your lint filter after every laundry load.\nBlocked vent system:  A blocked or restricted vent system will also prevent hot air from freely flowing through the dryer and cause longer drying times. Check the vent hose and exterior vent opening for any obstructions and clear them if necessary.\nOverloaded dryer:  Overloading the dryer with too many clothes prevents heat from moving evenly throughout the clothes, forcing the dryer to run for longer. Try reducing the size of the load and running multiple smaller loads instead.\nIncorrect dryer settings:  Using the wrong drying cycle or temperature setting for the type of fabric being dried can also lead to excessive drying times. Check your user manual and select the appropriate settings for your laundry.\n\n\n\nSamsung Dryer \"FE\" Error CodeThis error code is displayed when there is a problem with the power supply. It could mean that the dryer is not receiving adequate power or that there's an issue with the electrical connection. Electric Samsung dryers require a properly grounded 220/240-volt branch circuit, and a 30 amp circuit breaker, while Samsung gas dryers require a 110-volt, three-prong, grounded electrical outlet that is positioned close to the power cord. If there is an issue with the power supply in your home, it is recommended to call in a professional technician or electrician to handle the problem. However, if your dryer is receiving the power that it needs and this code is displayed, it may simply be a control board glitch. Turn the dryer off at the circuit breaker for 3-5 minutes before turning it back on again to fix the problem.\n\nSamsung Dryer \"tS\" or \"tO\" Error CodeThis error code indicates a problem with the temperature sensor in your dryer. This error can occur if the temperature sensor is faulty or if there's an issue with the wiring or connections related to the sensor. \n\nFirst inspect the sensor for any signs of wear or damage. \nNext, set your multimeter to the resistance or ohms setting.\nConnect the multimeter probes to the terminals of the temperature sensor. Make sure the probes make good contact with the terminals.\nThe multimeter should display a resistance reading. Typically, a working temperature sensor should show a specific resistance value within a certain range. Refer to your dryer's manual for the correct resistance value. If the reading falls out of the correct range, then you will need to replace the sensor.\n\n\nSamsung Dryer \"He\" or \"HE\" error code\nThis error code on either a Samsung gas or electric dryer usually indicates a problem with the heating element. It stands for \"Heating Element Error.\" It means that the dryer is not heating properly or not heating at all. This could be due to issues such as a faulty heating element, a defective thermostat, or problems with the wiring. \n\nGas Dryer: First check that the cut-off valve for the gas supply is fully open. If this does not resolve the issue, you will need to check the entire gas heating system. It is recommended to call a professional repair technician to do so. \nElectric Dryer: First check that the circuit breaker for the dryer has not tripped. If not, you will need to inspect the dryer's heating element or any damage or malfunction. If the element is faulty, you will need to replace it before you can resume using your dryer.\n\n\n\nSamsung Dryer \"bE\" Error CodeThis error code indicates that there is a stuck button on the control panel. This means that one of the buttons on the control panel is being held down or is stuck in the pressed position. This can prevent the dryer from working properly and it will make it difficult for you to input commands because the dryer thinks a button is being pressed continuously. To resolve this issue, try pressing each button on the control panel to ensure none of them are stuck. If you find a button that feels stuck, try gently tapping it to see if it releases. If you are unable to free the button, then you may need to replace the control panel.\n\nWe hope that this guide will help you understand your Samsung dryer better. It is important to note that the appearance of icons may vary slightly, and some icons may not be available for certain dryer models. For model-specific details, it is always recommended to refer back to your dryer's user manual whenever you are in doubt.

You might need to remove it, and it's a task you can handle without professional help. Our guide makes it easy, guiding you through safely disconnecting the water and power connections and using basic tools like a wrench, screwdriver, and pliers to remove the unit from below your countertop.\n\nReasons for Removing a Dishwasher\nSometimes, you might find yourself needing to take out your dishwasher, and there are a few good reasons why:\n\nUpgrading to a New Model: If you're eyeing that latest dishwasher model, it might be time to say goodbye to your old one and welcome a new, modern unit into your home.\nMaintenance or Repair: Dishwashers don't last forever. They can start to show their age, with parts wearing out or even breaking. Removing it is necessary for deep cleaning, troubleshooting, or repairing parts that are not easily accessible while it is installed.\nWater Damage or Mold: Water where it shouldn't be is a big no-no. If you spot leaks, water damage to your cabinets, or mold around your dishwasher, it's important to pull it out and fix the issue. Leaving it be can cause more damage over time.\nRelocation: Are you moving to a new place? You might need to remove your dishwasher either to take it with you because you really like it, or because the one waiting for you in the new place isn't up to scratch.\n\n\nFAQs About Removing a Dishwasher\nIf you're planning to remove your dishwasher, you might have some questions. Here, we've answered the most common ones to help you get ready for the next steps, where we'll show you exactly how to do it.\n\nCan I remove my dishwasher by myself?\nYes, you can! If you feel confident in following step-by-step directions and know your way around basic tools, you can uninstall your dishwasher on your own. However, if you’re unsure about any part of the process, especially when it comes to electrical or plumbing connections, it might be a good idea to call in a pro.\n\nWhat should I do if water leaks during the removal process?\nKeep a bucket or towels ready to catch any drips. If a leak occurs, ensure the water supply valve is fully turned off and clean up any spills right away to avoid damaging your floor or cabinets.\n\nHow do I dispose of my old dishwasher?\nRecycling is a great option. Check with your local waste management to see if they take large appliances like dishwashers. If your dishwasher is still in working condition, you might also think about donating it or selling it secondhand.\n\nHow to Remove a Dishwasher\nYou're now set to uninstall your dishwasher. With the right tools in hand, you're about to see how surprisingly straightforward this process can be.\nTools Needed to Remove a Dishwasher\n\nBucket and Old Towels\nWrench\nScrewdriver\nPliers\nOptional: Furniture Sliders or Dolly\n\n\nStep 1: Turn Off the Power\nSince you’ll be working with electrical wires, it’s important to turn off the power to the dishwasher. Head to your circuit breaker box and switch off the breaker for your dishwasher. To be sure you've turned off the right one, try turning on the dishwasher; if it stays off, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Turn Off the Water Supply\nYou'll need to stop the water flow to your dishwasher. Find the water shutoff valve connected to your dishwasher's water line—this is usually located under your sink. Gently turn the knob clockwise until it stops. Be careful not to overtighten it, as it could break.\n\nStep 3: Disconnect the Water Supply Hose\nFind the water supply hose that connects your dishwasher to the shutoff valve, usually located under the sink. Check the hose for leaks or rust. If it looks worn out, you'll want to change it to a replacement hose later when you're reinstalling the dishwasher. Get an adjustable wrench to unscrew the water line. Keep a bucket and some towels ready just in case water drips out. Then, with pliers, gently pull off the dishwasher's drain hose and put the end into the bucket to avoid water leaking out onto the floor.\n\nStep 4: Disconnect the Drain Hose\nThe next hose to disconnect is the drain hose, which links your dishwasher to either the sink or a garbage disposal unit, often through an air gap. Find the hose, loosen the clamp that holds it in place, and disconnect it. Once disconnected, aim the end of the hose into the bucket.\n\nStep 5: Remove the Mounting Brackets\nYour dishwasher is kept in place by some brackets that connect it to the bottom of your countertop. This stops it from shaking or moving when it's running. Just open the dishwasher door to find these brackets and unscrew them from the countertop. You can either leave the brackets attached to the dishwasher or remove them completely.\n\nStep 6: Lower the Legs\nBefore you can move your dishwasher, you will need to lower it by unscrewing the legs. Depending on the make and model of your dishwasher, you will either have legs that can be lowered straight away, or you’ll need to access them by removing a faceplate. The faceplate can usually be removed by unclipping it or unthreading its mounting screws.\n\nWhen you have access to the legs, lower them down by twisting them clockwise until they are as low as you can get them. This will create a gap between it and the countertop, making it easier to pull out.\n\nStep 7: Slide Out the Dishwasher\nGently pull the dishwasher away from its cavity. It’s great if someone can help you out here to make sure you don't drop it or pull too hard. Remember, there are water and power lines still attached, so be careful. Using furniture sliders or a dolly can also help with this step. Lift the dishwasher slightly as you pull it to avoid scratching your floor.\n\nStep 8: Final Disconnections\nWith the dishwasher partway out, you’ll find it easier to see and reach any remaining hoses or wires. Disconnect these carefully, making sure your dishwasher is entirely free and ready to be moved completely.\n\nWith the dishwasher out of the way, what's next? Depending on its condition, consider repairing, selling, donating, recycling, or responsibly disposing of it. Don't forget to prepare the space for any new installations. And if you're eager for more renovation projects, find your next venture in our extensive collection of home improvement guides.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This means that the washer is taking too long to fill with water or not filling at all. The code may also be displayed as F8 E1 or Lo FL depending on your washer model, however, they mean the same thing. The LF error is normally caused by a problem with the water supply, low water pressure, faulty water inlet valves, clogged inlet screens, or an incorrectly installed drain hose. This guide will walk you through identifying and troubleshooting the problem so you can get your washer running again in no time.\n\nWater Supply Taps are Closed\nCheck if the taps supplying water to the washer are fully turned on. The water supply tap is a manual valve typically found on the wall behind the washer. When it is open, it allows water to flow to the washer. If it is not completely open, water will be unable to fill the washer during the wash cycle, resulting in the LF error.\n\nHow to Open the Water Taps to Clear the Maytag Washer LF Error\n\nBegin by disconnecting the washing machine from the power source.\nPull the washer forward if you need to gain better access to the taps.\nTurn each valve handle or knob in a counterclockwise direction to open it.\nCheck for any leaks around the valve or hoses.\nIf you find that the water pressure is too high or too low, adjust the valve slightly to achieve the desired water flow.\nReconnect the washer to the power source and run a short cycle to confirm that the LF code is no longer displayed.\n\n\nIncorrectly Installed Drain Hose\nThe drain is responsible for carrying water out of the washer at the end of a cycle. However, if it is not properly installed, it can affect the water flowing into the washer. If the end of the drain hose is inserted too far into the standpipe or drain, it will cause a siphoning or vacuum effect. This means that water may continuously drain from the washer, which can prevent the washer from properly filling with water. \n\nHow to Correctly Position the Drain Hose to Clear the Maytag Washer LF Error Code\n\nAdjust Drain Hose Height: The drain hose should be positioned above the water level inside the washer. If it's too low, water can siphon out.\nInstall a Standpipe Air Gap: There should be an air gap between the end of the drain hose and the standpipe. If there is no air gap you can purchase one from your local hardware store and install it yourself. \nUse a Drain Hose Restraint: A drain hose restraint keeps the hose secure and can prevent the hose from moving and slipping too far into the standpipe.\nUse the Correct Drain Hose Length: A long hose can increase the chance of kinks and blockages which can affect the flow of water.\nPull the Washer Forward: Avoid pushing your washer too close to the wall as this may compromise the drain hose. Wherever possible, maintain a straight path for the hose to avoid sharp bends which can restrict water flow.\n \n\nFaulty Inlet Hoses\nThe inlet hoses are flexible, rubber tubes that connect your washing machine to the water supply. These hoses allow water to flow into the washer for each wash cycle. There is one hose for hot water and one for cold water. If these hoses are kinked or damaged, water will be unable to flow into the washer and fill it up at the appropriate time. \n\nHow to Clean and Replace the Inlet Hoses to Clear Maytag Washer LF Error \n\nEnsure the washing machine is unplugged from the power outlet to prevent the risk of electric shock.\n Locate the water supply valves connected to the washing machine and turn them off by turning the handles clockwise. These valves are typically located on the wall behind the washer or under a nearby sink.\nCarefully pull the washing machine away from the wall to create space to access the back panel. \nLocate the inlet hoses which are connected to the back of the washing machine. They are usually color-coded, with the hot water hose being red and the cold water hose being blue. \nDisconnect the hoses from the washer and carefully examine the entire length of each hose for any signs of wear, cracks, or leaks.\nIf you notice any damage, you will need to replace the hose to fix the LF error.\nInspect the hoses for any debris or buildup that could restrict water flow and carefully remove any blockages.\nOnce clear, reconnect the hoses to the washing machine and turn on the water supply.\nReconnect your washer to power to complete the repair.\n\n\nClogged Water Inlet Filters\nThe water inlet filters are protective coverings that prevent dirt and debris from flowing into the washing machine. They are found where the water hoses connect to the back of the washing machine. It is common for these filters to get clogged over time. This buildup restricts the flow of water into the washing machine, reducing the amount of water that enters the tub during the filling cycle and resulting in the LF error. If the filters are excessively clogged, water may not enter the washer at all. It is important to regularly clean them to ensure your washer runs optimally and it is recommended to replace the inlet filters every 6 months. You can browse our selection of Maytag inlet filters if it is time to replace yours. \n\nHow to Clean the Water Inlet Filters to Clear the Maytag Washer LF Error Code\n\nEnsure the washing machine is unplugged to ensure your safety.\nShut off the water supply valves connected to the washing machine to prevent water from flowing while you're working on it.\nDisconnect the water supply hoses from the back of the washer. \nLook inside the inlet valves on the back of the washer to locate the mesh filter.  \nCarefully remove the inlet filters. You may need a pair of needle-nose pliers.\nRun the filters under warm water and use a soft brush to remove any remaining buildup. Once clean, return the filters to their correct positions.  \nIf the filters are no longer usable, discard them and install the new ones.\nReconnect the water supply hoses and turn on the water supply. Ensure there are no leakages.\nTurn your washer back on and run a short cycle to check if the code has been cleared.\n\n\nFaulty Water Inlet Valve\nThe water inlet valve is responsible for controlling the flow of water into the washer. During the wash cycle, the inlet valve opens and allows water to fill the drum. When the correct level of water is reached, the inlet valve closes. If the valve is damaged or faulty it may be unable to allow water to freely flow into the washer. If it is faulty, you must replace the inlet valve to clear the LF error code.\n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Water Inlet Valve to Clear the Maytag LF Error Code\n\nUnplug the washer, turn off the water supply, and pull the washing machine forward for easier access.\nDisconnect the water hoses from the back of the washing machine.\nRemove the back panel of the washer to access the inlet valves.\nDisconnect the wiring from the water inlet valve.\nRemove the mounting hardware that secures the valve in place, and carefully pull it out of the washer.  \nPlace the new water inlet valve inside the washer and secure it using the appropriate screws.\nReconnect the wires to the new valve.\nReattach the back panel to the washer and ensure it is fixed in place.\nConnect each water supply hose to the new inlet valve.\nPlug the washer back in and test that the new valve is working correctly.\n\n\nLow Water Pressure\nThe water pressure in your home needs to be adequate for the washer to fill properly. Low water pressure can cause the washer to take longer to fill or not to fill at all. If the valves are open, and there are no leaks in the hoses, you should test your home's water supply using a water pressure test gauge. Typically, water pressure requirements for washing machines range from 20 psi to 120 psi. \n\nHow to Test Water Pressure Levels for Your Maytag Washer\n\nIdentify the water supply valve that provides water to your washing machine. It is usually located on the wall behind the washer or under a sink nearby.\nTurn off other water fixtures in your home that may be using water, such as faucets, showers, or toilets. \nAttach the pressure gauge to the water supply valve.\nSlowly turn on the water supply valve to allow water to flow through the pressure gauge. Monitor the pressure gauge to observe the water pressure reading.\nCheck the pressure reading. If the pressure is low, you may need to call in a plumber or a professional technician to look for any pipe blockages or issues with the plumbing lines.\n\n\nEncountering the LF error code in your Maytag washer can be frustrating! By first addressing potential problems such as water supply issues or blockages, you can easily troubleshoot your way through this error. However, if you are in doubt it is always best to call in a professional. Remember, regular maintenance, including cleaning water inlet filters and inspecting hoses, is key to optimizing your washer's performance and reducing the chance of any future problems. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

When you turn on the oven, the igniter begins to heat up rapidly. Once it reaches a certain temperature, it triggers the gas valve to open, allowing gas to flow into the burner. When the hot igniter and the gas meet, a flame is created. If the igniter is faulty, damaged, or covered in burnt-on residue, it will not be able to begin this process, and you will likely notice that your gas oven will have difficulties heating up. In this article, we'll go over the common signs of a faulty igniter, and give you step-by-step instructions on how to clean your igniter, test it with a multimeter, or replace it if necessary.  \n\nSigns of a Faulty Igniter\n\nNo Ignition or No Glow: If the oven doesn't ignite at all or if the flame is weak, it could be a sign of a malfunctioning igniter. Check to see if the igniter is glowing red-hot when the oven is turned on. If it's not, it has likely gone bad.\nDelayed Ignition: If there is a noticeable delay between turning on the oven and the appearance of the flame, the igniter may be struggling to reach the necessary temperature. This can lead to extended preheating times.\nUneven Cooking: A faulty igniter will often result in an inconsistent flame, which can lead to uneven cooking. If you notice that some parts of your food are cooking faster than others, it could be a sign of an issue with the igniter.\nUnusual Noises: Sometimes, a faulty igniter may produce excessive clicking or popping sounds during the ignition process. Unusual noises often indicate problems with the ignition system.\nVisible Damage: Physically inspect the igniter for any signs of damage, such as cracks or breakage. If any are present, the igniter will need to be replaced to restore the oven.\nExcessive Build-up: Over time food particles and other contaminants may fall onto the igniter. If this debris builds up it will eventually prevent the igniter from heating up and creating a flame.\n\n\nHow to Access the Igniter in a Gas Oven\n\nBefore any cleaning or repair, unplug the oven from the electrical outlet or turn off the circuit breaker for your safety.\nLocate the gas shut-off valve, usually located behind or beneath the oven and turn the valve off.\nTake out the oven racks to provide better access to the bottom of the oven.\nRemove the bottom panel of the oven and, carefully lift the panel away from the oven.\nLocate the Igniter. It is a small, rectangular or round component with wires attached to it, typically found near the oven burner.\nTake a picture of how the wires are connected to assist with reinstallation.\nDisconnect the wires attached to the igniter. \n\n\nHow to Clean the Igniter in a Gas Oven\n\nLocate the igniter near the oven burner at the back of the oven.\nUse a soft brush or a can of compressed air to gently remove any food particles, or grease from the igniter. Be careful not to apply excessive force to avoid damaging the igniter. Do not use water or any liquid cleaner on the igniter.\nFor hard-to-reach areas, you can use a Q-tip to gently dislodge any remaining debris.\nInspect the pilot hole and use a wooden toothpick to clean it out.\nIf the buildup is excessive and cannot be removed, you will need to replace the igniter to restore your gas oven.\nOnce you are done cleaning, turn on the oven and observe the igniter to see if it glows red-hot during the ignition process.\n\n\nHow to Test the Igniter in a Gas Oven\n\nFollow the instructions above for how to access the igniter.\nTurn on the multimeter and set it to the resistance (ohms) setting. If you're unsure about the proper range, consult your oven's manual for the specifications.\nCarefully disconnect the wires attached to the igniter.\nTouch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the igniter. The order doesn't matter for this test. Note the resistance reading on the multimeter. Compare this reading to the specified range in your oven's manual.\nIf the resistance falls within the specified range, the igniter is likely functioning correctly. If the resistance is significantly outside the range, the igniter is likely faulty and will need to be replaced.\nOnce the test is complete, reconnect the wires to the igniter. Make sure they are securely attached.\nReassemble the oven.\n\n\nHow to Replace Igniter in a Gas Oven\n\nFollow the instructions above to access the igniter.\nRemove the mounting screws that secure the old igniter to the burner assembly and gently pull the igniter out.\nAttach the new igniter to the mounting bracket or ceramic base and secure it with the mounting screws.\nRefer back to your picture from earlier and reconnect the wires appropriately.\nPut the bottom panel back in place and reinstall the oven racks.\nTurn on the gas supply using the shut-off valve and plug the oven back into the electrical outlet or turn on the circuit breaker.\nTurn on the oven and observe the igniter. It should begin to glow red-hot, indicating successful ignition.\n\n\nIdentifying the early signs of a faulty igniter in your gas oven not only empowers you to restore your gas oven but also contributes to a safer and more reliable cooking environment. The igniter is an important component of your gas oven and it is important to regularly inspect it and clean it, as this allows your oven to remain a reliable culinary companion for many more years. A well-maintained igniter sparks the flame for your favorite dishes and ensures a hassle-free and enjoyable cooking experience.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

The tumbling motion provides a more thorough clean while being gentler on your clothes than an agitator. Despite how hard working your front-load washer is, it isn’t invincible! Overloading the machine can cause strain on the motor and may result in you seeing an LE error code on the display. When this happens, it means that the tub can’t spin due to an issue with the motor. The machine may just be overloaded, or an object has caused a jam preventing the tub from spinning. We'll walk you through the steps to clear the LE error code from your LG washer, along with the parts you may need to inspect or replace on your machine.\n \n\nHow to Clear an LE Error Code on an LG Washer\n\nTo clear the LE error code, start by doing a hard reset of the machine.\n\nBegin by turning off the washer and then unplugging the power cord. \n\nWait at least 5 minutes, then plug the machine back in.\n\nThe code should now be cleared from the display.\n\nStart the wash cycle again, if the error code returns, follow the next steps below.\n\n \n\nRemove Excess Items from the Washer\n\nIf you reset your washer, started a new cycle, and the LE error code came back, then your washer may be overloaded. Remove some of the laundry from your washer, reset the machine, and try the cycle again. If the error code comes back again, there may be a lodged item preventing the tub from spinning.\n\nConstantly overloading your washer will strain the motor and can damage it to the point of failure. Be mindful when filling the machine, and if your LG washer has the option, select the “bedding cycle” when washing blankets or bulkier items. An oversized load should be taken to a commercial laundromat, as they have larger machines equipped for that purpose. Spending the time and money to run two smaller loads, or taking an oversized one to a laundromat, will ultimately save you in the long run as it reduced the wear and tear on your washer.\n\n\nRemove Foreign Objects\n\nIf the LE error code comes back again after removing excess laundry from your machine, there may be an object stuck which is preventing the drum from spinning. Remove all the laundry from the machine and see if you can manually turn the tub. If you find an object, remove it from the machine using pliers or tweezers if necessary.\n\nTo prevent this from happening in the future, inspect your clothing prior to loading the machine. Spare change, loose buttons, bra underwires, or objects like paperclips can all get lodged in your washer.\n\nIf there wasn’t anything stuck in your washer tub, but the error code is still persistent, the motor components may have been damaged and will need to be inspected.\n \n\nParts to Inspect on Your LG Washer\n\nConstantly overloading your washer puts strain on the motor. This will cause the components to wear faster than normal and require replacement. If you are frequently getting an LE error code on your LG washer, the following motor parts should be inspected. If needed they can replaced with a  new OEM motor part. \n\nRotor\n\nThe rotor ensures the tub of your washer can spin. It works with the stator to create an electromagnetic field, which in turn causes the tub to rotate. If the magnets on the rotor have become damaged or loose, it can result in your washer not spinning.\n\nHow to Access and Remove the Rotor\n\nThe rotor will be found at the back of your washer. Begin by disconnecting the power and water supply to your machine.\n\nNext, remove the back panel to access the rotor.\n\nRemove the bolt holding the rotor in place.\n\nOnce this is removed, you can remove the rotor and inspect it for damage.\n\n\nHow to Install a New Rotor\n\nTo install a new rotor, line up the opening on the motor shaft and push it into place. You may feel some resistance when lining the new rotor up, as the magnets are engaging with the stator.\n\nOnce the new rotor is in place, the bolt can be reinstalled and tightened.\n\nThe back panel can be reinstalled, and the water lines and power reconnected.\n \n\nRotor Positioning Sensor\n\nThe rotor positioning sensor communicates with the electronic control board in your washer to dictate the speed and direction that the tub spins. If the sensor is faulty, it may result in your washer not spinning.\n\nHow to Access and Remove the Rotor Positioning Sensor\n\nThe rotor positioning sensor is found behind the rotor and is clipped onto the stator.\n\nBegin by pulling the washer out from the wall and disconnecting the power and water lines.\n\nRemove the back panel of the washer, and the bolt holding the rotor in place.\n\nRemove the rotor from the shaft.\n\nYou may also need to remove the stator from the machine to access the sensor, which can be done by removing the various bolts holding it in place.\n\n\nHow to Install a New Sensor\n\nDepending on your model of washer, the sensor and stator may be sold as an assembly or as separate components. If they come as one piece, then the stator will also be replaced if the sensor has failed. If the sensor can be removed, unclip it from the stator and connect the new part in its place.\n\nReinstall and stator onto the shaft and secure the bolts in place.\n\nThen replace the rotor by fitting it over top of the stator, and install the bolt.\n\nThe back panel of the washer can now be reinstalled, and the water lines and power can be reconnected.\n\n \nYou can prevent LE error codes on your LG washer by washing suitable size loads of laundry, selecting the proper cycles, and ensuring that foreign objects don’t make their way into the tub. When problems do occur, we’ve got the repair resources and replacement parts to get your machine back up and running in no time.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This error may be displayed as E1 on certain models of LG dishwashers. It may be triggered by a faulty sensor, however it is commonly caused by using too much or incorrect detergent, a control board glitch, a worn-down door gasket, a faulty spray arm, or a faulty water inlet valve. This repair guide is designed to help you find the cause of the issue and troubleshoot it to clear the code and restore your LG dishwasher.\n\nHow Using Detergent Incorrectly Can Cause the AE Error\n\nUse one dishwasher pod per cycle: Your LG dishwasher is designed to use one pod at a time. Using more than one pod can lead to overflow and leaking, resulting in the AE error. \nUse the correct amount of detergent: Ensure that you are following the marked levels for correct amount of detergent to use otherwise you will have excessive suds and cause water to overflow, resulting in the AE error. In LG dishwashers, you should use the 15 Line for slightly dirty loads and the 25 Line for very dirty dishes with stuck-on food.\nDo not use dishwashing liquid: It may be tempting to reach for dishwashing liquid when you are out of pods/tablets, however, dishwashers are not designed for this. Using dishwashing liquid can lead to excessive suds and leaking. \n\n \nHow an LG Dishwasher That is Not Level Cause the AE Error\nIf your dishwasher is not level, water will not drain from the appliance. This can lead to overflow and leaking which triggers the AE error. Your dishwasher must be level for it to function properly. You can check whether it is level by placing a bubble level on the dishwasher door. The bubble should be centred within the lines and if it is not that is a signal that the appliance is not level. You can also pour water on the bottom of the dishwasher and check whether it pools to one side. If it does, this is also a signal that the washer is not level. To balance your dishwasher, you should firstly make sure that it is resting on a flat, even surface. If this does not resolve the issue, you will need to adjust the levelling legs which are found on the underside of the appliance. Turn the legs clockwise to raise their height and counterclockwise to lower them. \n\nHow a Faulty LG Dishwasher Door Gasket can Cause the AE Error\nThe door gasket is responsible for creating a watertight seal between the dishwasher door and tub. It prevents water from leaking out during use. It's typically made of rubber and you can find it around the perimeter of the dishwasher door. Over time, the door gasket may wear out or become damaged. If it has failed, you will need to find a replacement door gasket in order to clear the AE error. It is also possible for food and soap residue to build up on the door gaskets resulting in leakages and thereby causing the AE Error. \n\nHow to Replace the Door Gasket in Your LG Dishwasher\n\nOpen the dishwasher door and make note of how the old gasket is installed to help you position the new one later.\nCarefully peel off the old gasket from around the perimeter of the dishwasher door. \nThoroughly clean the area where the old gasket was installed. It may be helpful to use a gentle soap or a mixture of water and vinegar to remove any stubborn residue.\nStarting at one corner, press the new gasket in place, making sure it fits snugly all the way around. If the new gasket seems stiff, you can soak it in warm water for a few minutes before installation to make it softer.\nMake sure the gasket is properly aligned and fully seated against the door.\nClose the dishwasher door and check that it is properly aligned and tightly sealed.\nPlug the dishwasher back into the power supply.\nRun a short test cycle to ensure that the door gasket is working effectively. Check for any leaks during the cycle.\n\n\nHow a Faulty LG Dishwasher Float Sensor can Cause the AE Error\nThe float sensor is designed to monitor and control the water level inside the dishwasher. When you start a wash cycle, the dishwasher begins to fill with water and the float sensor helps monitor this process to avoid overfilling. The float sensor can trigger an alert or shut off the water supply incase of a leak or drainage issue. It is found at the bottom of the dishwasher's tub. Once the float reaches a certain level, the float sensor signals the dishwasher's water inlet valve to stop the flow of water. If it is faulty or damaged the sensor may be unable to detect the correct water levels thus resulting in the AE error.\n\nHow to Test the Float Sensor \n\nDepending on your dishwasher model, you may need to remove the bottom front panel or you may be able to access the float sensor from inside the dishwasher.\nThe float sensor is typically a small, plastic device that moves up and down with the water level. It is often located near the front or side of the dishwasher's interior.\nCarefully disconnect any wires connected to the float sensor.\nSet your multimeter to the continuity mode, and touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the float sensor. \nIf the multimeter beeps this indicates that the circuit is closed, and the float sensor is functioning correctly.\nIf there is no beep, then the circuit is open, and the float sensor is likely faulty.\n\n\nHow to Replace the Float Sensor in Your LG Dishwasher\n\nUnplug the dishwasher from the electrical outlet or turn off the circuit breaker.\nDepending on your dishwasher model, you may need to remove the lower access panel at the front.\nIdentify the float sensor and carefully disconnect any wiring or connectors attached to the float sensor. \nRemove any fasteners holding the float sensor in place and gently lift it out.\nPlace the new float sensor in the same position as the old one and secure it in place. \nReconnect any wiring or connectors to the new float sensor.\nPut the lower access panel back in place and secure it with screws.\nPlug the dishwasher back into the electrical outlet or turn the circuit breaker back on.\nRun a test cycle to ensure that the new float sensor is functioning correctly and the AE code has been cleared.\n\n\nHow a Faulty LG Dishwasher Spray Arm can Cause the AE Error\nThe spray arm distributes water throughout the dishwasher to rinse off and remove food particles and debris from the dishes. If the spray arm has any blockages or clogs, it may not distribute water evenly during the wash cycle. This can lead to an imbalance of water within the dishwasher, causing leaks. A damaged or warped spray arm may not spin properly, leading to uneven water distribution. This can result in water pooling in certain areas of the dishwasher, potentially causing leaks. If the spray arm itself has cracks or holes, water may escape from these openings, causing leaks.\n\nHow to Replace the Spray Arm in an LG Dishwasher\n\nBegin by disconnecting the dishwasher from the power outlet. \nOpen the dishwasher door and pull out the lower rack.\nThe spray arm is typically located on the bottom of the dishwasher. \nIn some dishwashers the spray arm is secured by a locking mechanism and in others it is a nut. If it has a locking mechanism, release it by turning it counterclockwise. If there is a nut, use the appropriate tool to unscrew it.\nTake the new spray arm and attach it in the same position where you removed the old one. \nSecure it by tightening the locking mechanism or nut.\nSlide the lower rack back into the dishwasher.\nReconnect the power to the dishwasher and turn on the water supply.\nRun a short test cycle to ensure that the new spray arm is working correctly. Check for any leaks or unusual noises.\n\n\nHow a Faulty Water Inlet Valve can Cause the AE Error\nThe water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher during usage. It allows water to enter during different cycles such as for tasks such as filling the tub, and rinsing. If the water inlet valve is faulty or malfunctioning, it can lead to inadequate water supply, overflow, or leakage which triggers the AE error code.\n\nHow to Replace the Water Inlet Valve in an LG Dishwasher\n\nDisconnect the dishwasher from the power source and shut off the water supply to the dishwasher.\nRemove the kick plate at the bottom of the dishwasher to access the valve.\nCarefully disconnect the water supply line from the water inlet valve. It is recommended to have a container or towel nearby as water may spill out at this point.\nCarefully disconnect the electrical wires connected to the water inlet valve. Take note of their positions or take a picture for reference during reinstallation.\nRemove the mounting hardware that holds the water inlet valve in place, and carefully detach the valve from the dishwasher.\nPosition the new water inlet valve in place and secure it with the screws.\nReconnect the electrical wires using your notes/image from earlier.\nReattach the water supply line to the new water inlet valve.\nTurn on the water supply and restore power to the dishwasher.\nCheck that the new valve is working by running a short cycle.  to ensure the new water inlet valve is functioning correctly.\nMonitor the dishwasher for any leaks and ensure that the AE code has been cleared.\n\n\nUnderstanding the various causes behind the AE error code will help you to quickly and easily clear the code and restore your dishwasher. By following the proper use instructions for your dishwasher as well as performing regular maintenance, you will be able to avoid this error code and keep your dishwasher running for longer. If you are in need of new LG dishwasher parts for your appliance, you can browse our wide selection of OEM replacement parts.

However, even the most advanced technologies can encounter occasional hiccups, and one common concern faced by Samsung refrigerator owners is when the ice maker can't make any ice. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the most common fixes, which are inspecting the water supply, temperature settings and switches; performing a reset on your ice maker; and checking the ice bin. From there, it could be an issue with your water filter, water inlet valve, auger motor, ice molds, or water lines. Finally, if the ice maker assembly as a whole needs replacing, we can walk you through this process, too. Whether it's a minor issue or a more involved repair, this article will equip you with the knowledge to diagnose and resolve the problem, ensuring that your ice maker operates at its optimal capacity.\n\nCommon Issues to Check First\n\nWater Supply is Off: Ensure that the water supply to the refrigerator is connected and turned on.\nIncorrect Temperature Settings: Make sure that the freezer is set to the proper temperature. The recommended temperature for the freezer is typically around 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).\nIce Maker Switch is Off: Check if the ice maker switch is in the \"On\" position. Sometimes, it might accidentally be turned off.\nFull Ice Bin: Ensure that the ice bin is properly installed and not overfilled. If the bin is full, the ice maker may stop producing ice.\nMinor Glitch: The ice maker may be experiencing a minor technical glitch. Press and hold the \"Test\" button until you hear a chime and allow the ice maker to complete the reset process. It will take approximately 5 - 10 minutes.\n\n\nWater Line Issues\nThe water lines refer to the tubes or pipes that carry water to and from the ice maker. They are found at the back of the refrigerator. There are typically two main water lines associated with a Samsung ice maker: the supply line brings water from your home's plumbing to the refrigerator, and the ice maker line delivers water to the ice maker tray, where it is frozen into ice cubes. Frozen lines, clogs, or kinks will hinder water flow or stop it altogether. Ultimately, inadequate water flow will prevent the water reaching your ice maker, resulting in difficulties making ice.\n\nHow to Inspect Water Lines to Fix a Samsung Ice Maker\n\nCheck for kinks, bends, or obstructions: Straighten out any kinks and make sure the line is not being compressed or pinched.\nCheck for cross connection: If you are the owner of a new Samsung refrigerator, confirm that each of the water lines is connected to the correct slot.\nCheck for frozen water lines: Look for ice or frost build up along the water line. Use a blowdryer or warm towels to thaw the ice and check if the water pressure improves. \nCheck for leaks: Inspect the water line and connections for any leaks that might be contributing to low water pressure. Tighten any loose connections to restore the water flow.\n\n\nExpired Water Filter\nWater filters are rated for 300 gallons of usage, or for roughly 6 months of usage. If you have not replaced your filter in a while, this may be the reason why your ice maker is not working. However, if your filter is new, then you may need to visually inspect it. If the water filter is it's clogged or damaged it will restrict water flow to the ice maker. If this is the case, you will need to replace the water filter to restore your Samsung ice maker. You can find the right OEM water filter for your Samsung fridge by using our Water Filter Finder feature!\n\nHow to Replace the Water Filter to Fix a Samsung Ice Maker \n\n\nLocate the water filter. In most Samsung refrigerators, the water filter is usually located in the upper-right corner of the refrigerator compartment.\nIf your refrigerator has a water dispenser, turn off the water supply to the refrigerator. This is typically done by shutting off the water valve behind or beneath the refrigerator.\nOpen the filter compartment door. Depending on your model, this may involve pushing a button or flipping a latch.\nRotate the old water filter counterclockwise to release it. Some models may have a push-button release. Be prepared for some water to spill, so have towels or a bucket handy to catch any drips.\nRemove the protective cover from the new water filter. Check the manufacturer's instructions for any specific preparation steps.\nInsert the new water filter into the filter housing and rotate it clockwise until it locks into place. If your model has a push-button release, follow the manufacturer's instructions to secure the filter.\nRun water through the dispenser for a few minutes to flush any air or loose carbon particles from the new filter. This helps ensure the water quality and the proper functioning of the ice maker.\nSome Samsung refrigerators have a water filter indicator that needs to be reset after replacing the filter. Refer to your manual for instructions on resetting the indicator.\nTurn on the water supply to the refrigerator.\nVerify that there are no leaks around the filter and water connections.\nAllow some time for the ice maker to start producing ice. Monitor its operation to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\n\nFaulty Water Inlet Valve\nThe water inlet valve plays a crucial role in supplying water to your Samsung ice maker, controlling the flow of water and regulating the amount and timing of its delivery. If this part isn't working properly, it may fail to deliver water, or deliver it incorrectly, hindering the ice-making process. If your water inlet valve is not delivering water to your ice maker, here's how to replace it with one of our OEM water inlet valves.\n\nHow to Replace the Water Inlet Valve to Fix a Samsung Ice Maker\n\nUnplug the refrigerator from the power source or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure your safety during the repair.\nThe water inlet valve is usually located at the back of the refrigerator, behind an access panel. Remove the panel using a screwdriver.\nThe water inlet valve is connected to the water supply line and typically has two solenoids—one for the ice maker and one for the water dispenser.\nShut off the water supply to the refrigerator, and disconnect the water supply line from the inlet valve.\nDisconnect the wire connectors to the solenoids. Take note of how the wires are routed or take a picture for reference during reassembly.\nUse a screwdriver to remove any screws securing the water inlet valve to the refrigerator.\nInstall the new water inlet valve in the reverse order. Attach it to the refrigerator, secure it with screws, and reattach the wire connectors and water supply lines.\nTurn on the water supply to the refrigerator and check for any leaks. Tighten connections if necessary.\nPlug the refrigerator back in or turn on the circuit breaker.\nAllow some time for the ice maker to start producing ice. Monitor its operation to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\n\nFaulty Auger Motor \nThe auger motor in a Samsung refrigerator is a component responsible for rotating the auger or dispenser bucket, which helps dispense ice from the ice maker. The auger is a helix-shaped rod inside the ice bucket that rotates to move the ice toward the dispenser chute. The auger motor is what drives this rotation. If the auger motor is malfunctioning or fails, it can result in issues with the ice maker and dispenser, leading to a failure to dispense ice.\n\nHow to Replace the Auger Motor to Fix a Samsung Ice Maker \n\nUnplug the refrigerator from the power source or turn off the circuit breaker before beginning any repairs.\nThe auger motor is typically located behind the ice dispenser in the freezer door. You may need to remove the ice bin to access it.\nEmpty the ice bin and remove it from the freezer. This may involve pressing a release button or lifting it out, depending on your refrigerator model.\nDepending on your refrigerator model, you may need to remove the front panel or dispenser cover to access the auger motor.\nDisconnect the wiring harness that connects the auger motor to the refrigerator. Take note of the orientation of the connectors for reassembly.\nUse a screwdriver to remove any screws securing the auger motor to the housing.\nInstall the new auger motor in the same orientation as the old one. Secure it in place using the mounting screws.\nReconnect the wiring harness, ensuring a secure and proper connection.\nIf you removed any panels or covers, reassemble them in the reverse order of removal.\nPlug the refrigerator back in or turn on the circuit breaker.\nTest the ice dispenser to check if the auger motor is functioning properly. Allow some time for the ice maker to produce new ice.\n\n\nClogged Ice Mold \nThe ice mold, as mentioned earlier, is a component in the ice maker where water is frozen to create ice cubes. It typically consists of individual compartments that fill with water and freeze, forming the ice cubes. Once the ice is fully frozen, the ice maker ejects or releases the cubes into the ice bin for storage until needed. If the ice molds are clogged it can obstruct the proper distribution of water into the molds, and larger clogs can prevent the valve that controls the release of water into the mold from opening or closing effectively. As a result, the ice maker can fail to make ice properly, or may stop making ice altogether.\n\nHow to Clear a Blocked Ice Mold to Fix a Samsung Ice Maker\n\n\nOpen the freezer compartment and locate the ice maker. The ice mold is the part where water is poured to create ice cubes.\nLook for any visible ice buildup in the ice mold. Ice can accumulate on the mold's surface, preventing proper ice cube release.\nIf you see ice buildup, use a plastic utensil or your fingers to gently break up and remove the excess ice. You can also use a blow dryer to melt the ice. \nInspect for any water leaks that may be contributing to the ice buildup. Address any leaks promptly to prevent further issues.\nAfter clearing the ice buildup, allow some time for the ice maker to cycle and produce new ice cubes. \n\n\nFaulty Door Switch\nThe door switch is typically responsible for detecting whether the refrigerator or freezer door is open or closed. If the door switch is faulty, it may fail to register that the door is closed, and cut power to the ice maker, or disrupt the temperature regulation system in the freezer. You will need to inspect the door switch for any signs of physical damage, or test it with a multimeter to for electrical failure. Use our model search  feature to find the right door switch for your refrigerator. \n\nHow to Test the Door Switch on a Samsung Refrigerator\n\nDisconnect the refrigerator from the power outlet for your safety. \nLocate the door switch inside the refrigerator or freezer compartment. It is a small button or lever that is activated when the door is closed.\nDepending on your refrigerator model, you may need to remove a cover or panel to access the door switch. \nCarefully disconnect any wires attached to the old door switch. Take note of the wire placement or take a picture to assist you during the installation of the new switch.\nTurn the dial on your multimeter to the continuity or ohms setting.\nPlace one multimeter probe on one terminal of the door switch and the other probe on the other terminal. Press or activate the door switch as it would be when the door is closed.\nThe multimeter should beep or show a reading close to zero ohms, indicating continuity.\nRelease the door switch or allow it to return to its normal state when the door is open.\nThe multimeter should not beep, and the reading should show \"OL\" (over limit), which indicates an open circuit.\nIf the door switch passes both tests then it is likely functioning correctly.\nIf the door switch fails either test, it is likely faulty and in need of replacement.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Door Switch to Fix Samsung Ice Maker\n\nWith the wires already disconnected, remove the old switch by gently releasing any clips or screws holding it in place.\nAttach the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new door switch using your notes or image from earlier.\n Position the new switch in the correct place and secure it in place using clips or screws.\nIf you had to remove any covers or panels, reattach them securely.\nReconnect the refrigerator to the power outlet monitor the ice maker over the next 24 hours.\n\n\nFaulty Ice Maker Assembly \nIf you've inspected and tested the various components that make up the ice maker assembly, detailed above, or you're not sure which individual component is responsible and want to be sure of a speedy repair, sometimes the best option is to replace the ice maker assembly altogether. The process is easy and we will walk you through the steps to installing your new OEM Samsung Ice Maker Assembly.\n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Ice Maker Assembly to Fix a Samsung Ice Maker\n\nDisconnect the power and water supply to the refrigerator. Turn off the water supply valve and disconnect the water line from the back of the refrigerator.\nThe ice maker is typically located in the freezer compartment. If there is an ice bin in the freezer, remove it to access the ice maker.\nUse a screwdriver to remove any screws securing the ice maker assembly. These screws may be on the sides or ceiling of the freezer compartment. \nLocate the wiring harness that connects the ice maker to the refrigerator. Carefully disconnect the wiring harness. Note the orientation of the connectors for reassembly.\nOnce the screws and wiring harness are disconnected, carefully lift the old ice maker assembly out of its position. Be cautious not to damage any surrounding components.\nPosition the new ice maker assembly in the same orientation as the old one. Secure it in place using the mounting screws. \nReconnect the wiring harness, ensuring a secure and proper connection.\nReconnect the water line to the new ice maker. Turn on the water supply valve.\nPlug the refrigerator back in or turn on the circuit breaker.\nAllow some time for the new ice maker to cycle and start producing ice. Monitor its operation to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\n\nWhether your Samsung ice maker was acting up due to a minor issue or a more complex part replacement issue, following these steps in order should restore your ice maker! Regular maintenance, such as cleaning the ice maker and keeping the freezer compartment organized, can contribute to its optimal performance. By staying proactive and addressing issues promptly, you can ensure that your Samsung ice maker continues to produce ice efficiently, providing you with a steady supply of refreshing cubes for your beverages.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This issue can be caused by power supply problems, a malfunctioning door latch, or even an activated child lock. By following this easy-to-understand guide, you can diagnose and fix these issues in just a few steps.\n\nWhat Does a Flashing Red Light Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher That Won't Start?\nYour dishwasher can come with some helpful indicator lights. One of them is the InfoLight, a small red light projected onto the floor while the dishwasher is running. This lets you check the dishwasher's status when it is operating silently. Normally, this light should turn off when the cycle completes or when the dishwasher is not in use. However, if you notice the InfoLight flashing or staying on when the appliance is idle, it may indicate that the door isn't securely latched. Be sure to listen for a distinct clicking sound and feel for resistance when you close the door.\n\nThe dishwasher may also have an LED light in the lower right corner of the control panel. This light turns red while the dishwasher is running, showing that it's in the middle of a cycle. After the cycle is complete, the light changes to green and stays on for two hours. However, if you notice it flashing, it could indicate a problem with the water supply. Be sure to check that the water supply to the dishwasher is turned on.\n\nWhy Is Your Bosch Dishwasher Not Starting?\nWhen your dishwasher refuses to start, whether it is accompanied by indicator lights or not, these common causes could be at play:\n\nPower Supply Issues: Sometimes, the problem can be as simple as a tripped or overloaded circuit breaker. Make sure the dishwasher’s plug is securely connected and inspect your home’s electrical panel.\nControl Panel Malfunctions: The issue may lie with the dishwasher's control panel, particularly the main control board. This board is responsible for sending signals to various components of the dishwasher to initiate the cycle. If these signals are incorrect or interrupted, the dishwasher won’t start.\nDoor Latch Failure: The door latch prevents the dishwasher from running if the door isn't properly locked. If the door latch is found to be faulty, it needs to be replaced.\n\n\nHow to Fix a Bosch Dishwasher That Is Not Starting\nResetting a Bosch Dishwasher\nResetting your dishwasher can often resolve non-starting issues by clearing temporary glitches and restoring the machine's default settings. Here’s what you need to do:\n\nResetting Standard Models\n\nOn your dishwasher's control panel, locate the ‘Start’ button.\nPress and hold the ‘Start’ button for about 5 seconds. After releasing the button, wait for a moment. The dishwasher should reset itself.\n\n\nResetting Older Models\n\nFor older Bosch models, find the ‘Power’ button, which may be used instead of the ‘Start’ button.\nPress the ‘Power’ button to turn off the machine, then press it again to turn it back on.\n\n\nPerforming a Hard Reset\nIf the standard reset methods don’t work on your Bosch dishwasher, a hard reset might be necessary. This process involves cutting off and then restoring the power supply to the dishwasher, which can reset its internal systems.\n\nFind the circuit breaker in your home that controls the power supply to your dishwasher.\nSwitch off the circuit breaker for the dishwasher. By doing this, you're cutting off the power supply to the machine.\nLeave the circuit breaker off for about 5 minutes. This brief period is critical as it allows the dishwasher’s systems to fully reset.\nFlip the circuit breaker back on to restore power to the dishwasher.\n\n\nAfter completing these steps, try starting your dishwasher again. Often, a hard reset can fix minor issues. However, if your dishwasher still won't start, it could be a sign of a more complex problem.\n\nDisabling the Child Lock on a Bosch Dishwasher\nAn engaged child lock on your Bosch dishwasher can be a sneaky culprit behind the appliance not starting. This safety feature, designed to prevent unintended use, can render the control panel inactive, leading to what appears to be a non-starting problem. To disable it, this is how it's done:\n\nLook for the button on your dishwasher's control panel that's marked with a padlock or child symbol. The position of this button can vary depending on your Bosch model.\nPress and hold the child lock button for a few seconds, usually around 3 to 5 seconds. You should hear a beep or see a light indicator, signaling that the child lock has been deactivated.\nOnce the child lock is off, try pressing other buttons on the control panel to ensure they are responsive.\nNow that the control panel is active again, select your desired wash cycle and start the dishwasher as usual.\n\nRemember, the child lock feature is there for safety, so it's a good idea to activate it again if necessary once you've started your dishwasher.\n\nInspecting, Testing, and Replacing the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher\nThe door latch on your Bosch dishwasher does two important things: it keeps the door shut tight so no water leaks out, and electronically communicates with the dishwasher's control system. When you close the door and it clicks, the engaged latch tells the system that it's safe to start the wash cycle. If the latch is malfunctioning, this signal isn't sent, preventing the dishwasher from starting as a safety precaution. When troubleshooting the assembly, always refer to your Bosch dishwasher’s manual for specific instructions related to your model. To get started, do the following:\n\nHow to Inspect and Clean the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher\nThe door latch is a small, typically metallic mechanism located at the top center of the dishwasher door. It features a handle or lever that clicks into place, securing the door when closed and engaging with the corresponding latch on the dishwasher frame.\n\nBefore anything else, ensure your safety by turning off the dishwasher at the circuit breaker.\nExamine the latch for any visible signs of damage or wear. Look for any bends, breaks, or rust that could hinder its function.\nSometimes, food particles or other debris can obstruct the latch mechanism. Using a soft, damp cloth, gently clean around the latch mechanism. Be careful not to use too much water, as this could seep into the electrical components.\nIf there’s hardened debris or grime, lightly scrub the area with a soft-bristled toothbrush to loosen and remove it.\nOnce cleaned, dry the latch area thoroughly with a cloth to prevent any moisture buildup.\nGently close the dishwasher door to see if the latch clicks into place properly. A proper latch should be smooth with a distinct click sound.\nEnsure that the latch aligns correctly with the catch on the dishwasher frame. Misalignment can prevent proper latching and, consequently, stop the dishwasher from starting.\n\n\nHow to Test the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher\nEven if it seems to latch properly, it's essential to test its functionality to determine if it needs replacing:\n\nWith the dishwasher disconnected from the power source, open the door and locate the latch assembly, typically at the top. You might need to remove the inner door panel to reach the latch’s electrical components.\nSet your multimeter to the continuity setting, indicated by a wave-like symbol or the word \"CONT.\"\nTouch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the latch assembly. A functioning latch should show continuity, often indicated by a beep or a reading near zero on the multimeter.\nNo continuity (no beep or a non-zero reading) suggests a malfunction in the latch, implying it may require replacement.\nIf the test fails, verify that all connections to the latch are secure and intact, as loose wiring can also cause issues.\n\n\nHow to Replace the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher\nIf the door latch assembly on your Bosch dishwasher failed the continuity test, it's time to replace it. Here are the steps to replace it:\n\nCarefully remove the old door latch assembly. This might involve disconnecting a few wires, so it's a good idea to take a picture or note down wire placements for easy reassembly.\nTake the new door latch assembly and connect it to the door. Make sure to reconnect any wires exactly as they were on the old latch, referring to your photo or notes.\nOnce connected, secure the new latch in place. Ensure it is properly aligned and screwed in tightly.\nBefore reassembling everything, test the door to ensure the new latch clicks into place and holds the door securely.\nPut back any components or panels you removed during the process. Ensure everything is back in its place and securely fastened.\nOnce everything is reassembled, reconnect the dishwasher to the power source and perform a test run to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\n\nReplacing the door latch assembly is a detailed process, so if you're not comfortable with appliance repair, consider consulting a professional. Using the correct replacement parts and following these steps carefully will help ensure your Bosch dishwasher runs smoothly again.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

If these issues are resolved but your dryer still won't start, then you will need to look at faulty parts that may need replacement. The most common parts behind GE dryer starting issues are a faulty door switch, a faulty start switch, or a blown-out thermal fuse. However, other parts that may cause issues starting your dryer include the timer, control board, and motor. Understanding the reasons why your GE dryer won't start is the first step towards getting your appliance back in working order. This guide is specially designed to help you whether you own a gas or electric GE dryer by providing you with simple step-by-step troubleshooting instructions to resolve each one of the issues mentioned above. \n\nCommon Issues to Check First\n\nCheck the Power Supply: Inspect the circuit breaker to ensure that the dryer's circuit is receiving power. The electrical supply to the dryer may be disrupted if you have a tripped breaker. You should also inspect the power cord for any damage, and ensure the power outlet is working properly. \nEnsure the Door is Closed: The dryer door has a safety feature that prevents it from starting if the door is not closed properly. Inspect the door latch for any obstructions and ensure that the door is securely shut. \nCheck the Dryer Personality Settings: For newer GE dryers you will need to use the \"Start\" button to ensure that the dryer personality settings are correct. If you have an electrical dryer it must be set to \"1\" and if you have a gas dryer, it must be \"2\".\nCheck the Child Lock Feature: This feature disables the control panel to prevent injury. If it is switched on, your dryer will not start. Check that it is switched off if you are attempting to use your dryer.\nReset your GE Dryer The control board controls the functions of the dryer. If it experiences any minor glitches, your dryer will likely fail to start. Look for error codes or unusual displays on the control panel. You can reset the dryer by unplugging it or turning it off at the circuit breaker for 3 - 5 minutes before attempting to use it again. \n\n\nFaulty GE Dryer Door Switch\nThe door switch is a safety mechanism found along the door frame of the dryer. It prevents the dryer from running when the door is open to prevent accidents and potential injury. The switch is activated when the door is closed and it disengages when the door is open.\nIf the door switch is damaged, worn out, or faulty, your dryer will likely fail to start or it may stop running midcycle. You will need to inspect the switch and test it with a multimeter to check that it is working properly. If it is faulty you will need to replace the door switch to fix your dryer.\n\nHow to Find and Test the Door Switch\n\nDisconnect the dryer from the power outlet or turn off the circuit breaker. \nDepending on your model, you may need to lift the top panel of the dryer to access the door switch. \nTake a picture of how the door switch wires are routed and connected before carefully disconnecting the wires from the switch terminals. \nOpen the dryer door and remove the screws that hold the door switch in place and pull it out of the dryer. \nInspect the door switch for signs of damage or general wear. If any damage is present, the switch will need to be replaced. If you can not see any damage, you will need to test the switch for continuity. \nTake your multimeter and set the meter to the \"continuity\" or \"ohms\" setting.\nTouch one probe of the multimeter to one of the switch terminals and the other probe to the other terminal. Close the dryer door to engage the switch and again touch each probe to the switch terminals. Check to see if the reading is in the correct range. It may be helpful to refer to your user manual for the exact specifications.\nOpen the dryer door to disengage the switch, and again, test the switch terminals. You should see an \"open\" or \"infinite\" reading, indicating that the circuit is not complete, and the switch is open. \nIf the readings do not fall into the specified ranges, then the switch has failed and needs to be replaced.\n\n\nHow to Install a Door Switch to Fix a GE Dryer that Won't Start\n\nWith the wiring already disconnected, simply remove the mounting hardware that holds the switch in place. \nPull the old door switch out and discard it.\nTake your new door switch place it in the same position and secure it in place. \nRefer to your image from earlier and reconnect the wire harness to the new switch.\nReassemble the dryer in reverse order.\nPlug in your dryer and check that the door switch is working and the dryer is running.  \n\n\nFaulty GE Dryer Start Switch\nThe start switch is a button or a knob on the dryer's control panel. When you press or turn the start switch, electricity flows to the dryer's motor. This process starts the motor and allows the dryer to run. If the start switch is faulty, your dryer will not start, and the switch will need to be replaced. You can use our model search feature to find the right replacement start switch for your GE dryer. \n\nHow to Find and Test the Start Switch\n\nUnplug the dryer from the electrical outlet or turn off the circuit breaker.\nYou may need to remove the back panel or the control panel to access the wiring.\nLocate the wires connected to the start switch, and take a picture of how the wires are connected for the installation process later.\nDisconnect the wires to the start switch.\nSet your multimeter to the continuity settings and touch the probes to the terminals on the start switch. If it's a push-button switch, press the button while testing.\nThe start switch should show continuity when tested. If it does not, the switch is faulty and will need to be replaced.\n\n\nHow to Install a Start Switch to Fix a GE Dryer that Won't Start\n\nUse a screwdriver to remove any screws holding the old start switch in place.\nCarefully pull out the old start switch and dispose of it appropriately.\nPosition the new start switch in the same location and secure the new start switch in place using the screws you removed earlier.\nReconnect the wires to the appropriate terminals on the new start switch.\nIf you removed a panel to access the control panel, reattach it and secure it with the screws.\nPlug the dryer back in or turn on the circuit breaker.\nCheck that the new start switch is working by pressing or turning it to initiate the dryer cycle.\n\n\nFaulty GE Dryer Thermal Fuse\nThe thermal fuse is a safety device used in dryers to prevent overheating. It is responsible for shutting off the power to the dryer if the temperature inside the dryer gets too high. The thermal fuse is designed for one-time use, therefore, if it trips or blows, you will need to replace the fuse. You can find the thermal fuse near the blower vent. However, on gas dryers, the thermal fuse can also be located near the burner. It may be helpful to consult your dryer's schematic to be sure of the exact location \n\nHow to Find and Test the Thermal Fuse\n\nRemove the back panel of the dryer to access the thermal fuse.\nOnce you've located the thermal fuse, make a note of how the wire connectors are routed, or use your phone to take a picture.\nCarefully disconnect the wires from the terminals. Some thermal fuses have terminals that can be pulled off, while others may be connected with screws or other connectors.\n Set your multimeter to the continuity or resistance setting.\nTouch the multimeter probes to each terminal of the thermal fuse. If the thermal fuse is not blown, you should hear a beep if it is set to continuity or see a resistance reading close to zero ohms.\nIf there is no beep indicating continuity or there is a very high resistance reading, this indicates that the thermal fuse has blown and needs to be replaced.\n\n\nHow to Install a Thermal Fuse to Fix a GE Dryer that Won't Start\n\nWith the wires already removed from the old thermal fuse, remove any screws or clips securing the thermal fuse to the housing.\nRemove the old fuse and position the new one in its place.\nSecure the new thermal fuse in place with the appropriate mounting hardware.\nReconnect the wires to the new thermal fuse. Refer to your notes/image from earlier to ensure you connect the wires correctly.\nIf you removed any panels to access the thermal fuse, reattach them now.\nPlug the dryer back in or reconnect it to the power source to complete your repair.\n\n\nFaulty GE Dryer Timer\nThe timer controls the length of the drying cycles. It contains a small motor which is responsible for turning the electric contacts on and off inside the timer. If the timer's motor or contacts are malfunctioning, you may notice difficulties controlling or completing the cycles. Eventually, the dryer may also be unable to start. You will need to inspect the timer for signs of aging or damage and check for electrical failure using a multimeter. If it is indeed faulty, you will need to replace the timer to fix your GE dryer. You can find the timer inside the dryer's control panel.\n\nHow to Find and Test the Timer\n\nBegin by unplugging your washing machine and shutting off the gas if you have a gas dryer.\nYou will need to access the underside of the control panel to reach the timer. Depending on your dryer, you may have to remove the back panel to access it. \nOnce you have located the timer, take a picture of how the wires are routed and connected to help you with installation later.\nCarefully disconnect the wire connectors to the timer. \nInspect the timer for any damage. If there is none, you will need to test the timer for electrical failure. \nIt is helpful to refer to your dryer's wiring diagram to know which set of contacts you need to test with the multimeter. \nOnce you’ve noted these, touch the multimeter probes to the appropriate terminals on the timer.\nIf there is no reading or the reading is outside of the specified range, then the timer has failed, and it will need to be replaced. \n\n\nHow to Install a Timer to Fix a GE Dryer that Won't Start\n\nRemove any mounting screws or clips that are holding the timer in place. \nPull out the timer and dispose of it appropriately. \nPlace your new timer inside the console and plug in the wire harnesses. \nReinstall the mounting screws to secure the timer in place. \nReassemble the dryer in reverse order. \nRestore the power supply to the dryer and check that it is now functioning properly. \n\n\nFaulty GE Dryer Control Board\nThe control board sends and receives signals from various components within the dryer to control the functions of the dryer.

To fix this, you can start with a simple reset: unplug the dryer for a few minutes and then plug it back in. If the E64 error still shows up after you reset, you may need to inspect and potentially replace one of these parts.\n\nWhat is the E64 Error Code on a Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer?\nIf your Frigidaire or Electrolux dryer displays an E64 error, it indicates a problem with the heating system. This error applies to both brands since Frigidaire is a subsidiary of Electrolux, and their dryers frequently have similar designs and components. This problem could be caused by: \n\nLoose Wiring or Damaged Power Cord: Electrical wiring in dryers is essential for powering the heating element, sensors, and controls. Wires can become loose, frayed, or damaged due to heat, movement, or aging. This can lead to shorts or interruptions in the electrical flow, potentially causing the error.\nFaulty Parts: The key heating components, the heating element, thermal fuse, and cycling thermostat, can fail due to wear over time. When this happens, the dryer may not heat effectively or safely, which can trigger the error.\nClogged Lint Screen: A blocked lint screen can restrict proper airflow, causing the heating system to overheat or malfunction, leading to the error code. Remember to regularly clean and maintain the lint screen.\n\n\nHow to Clear the E64 Error Code on Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer\nWhen you see an E64 code on your Frigidaire or Electrolux dryer, first try resetting it. This easy step can often solve the error. If not, parts like the lint screen, heating element, thermal fuse, or cycling thermostat may need replacement.\n\nHow to Reset a Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer\nPower cycling is a simple process that can clear error codes and fix minor issues. To perform a power cycle on your Frigidaire or Electrolux dryer, follow these steps:\n\nSwitch off the dryer using its power button or control panel.\nPhysically unplug the dryer from its power source.\nLeave the dryer unplugged for about 1-2 minutes. This waiting period allows any residual power  to dissipate.\nReconnect the dryer to the power source.\nPower on the dryer. It should start up as normal, and you can check to see if the E64 error code has been cleared.\n\n\nHow to Inspect and Clean the Lint Screen on a Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer\nIf the lint screen in your Frigidaire or Electrolux dryer is dirty, it can block the air from moving freely. This can make the dryer get too hot and might damage the heating element. So, it's important to clean the lint screen regularly to avoid the E64 error. Here's how you can do it:\n\nUnplug the dryer from its outlet.\nFind the lint screen either inside the dryer door or on top of the dryer.\nGently pull it out. For some models, you may need to turn it counterclockwise to release it.\nRemove as much lint as you can by hand.\nUse a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to suck out any remaining lint.\nAfter vacuuming, wash the screen with soapy water. Use a mild detergent or dish soap. Gently scrub the screen with a soft brush or sponge to remove stubborn lint or residue.\nRinse the lint screen thoroughly under running water, ensuring all soap residue is washed off.\nLet it air dry completely before you put it back in the dryer.\n\n\nHow to Inspect and Replace the Heating Element on a Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer\nThe heating element is an electrical device that generates heat used to dry clothes. It looks like a long, coiled wire. It may be encased in a metal housing or tube. You'll usually find it located around the drum area, often at the back. The heater coils may become damaged over time, preventing proper heating and causing the E64 code. Signs of a damaged heating element include gaps in the coil, discoloration, distortion, corrosion, or evidence of charring or melting. Follow these steps to inspect it:\n\nAlways unplug the dryer from its power source before starting.\nDepending on your dryer model, you may need to remove the top panel, control panel, and the front panel to access the heating element. This usually involves removing screws and gently lifting off these parts.\nSet your multimeter to the ohms setting. Disconnect the heating element from the circuit by removing any connected wires.\nPlace the multimeter probes on the terminals of the heating element. A good heating element should show some resistance on the multimeter (typically between 10 to 50 ohms, but this can vary). No resistance (infinity) indicates a faulty element.\nIf the heating element is faulty, remove it by detaching any mounting screws or brackets holding it in place.\nInstall the new heating element by securing it in the same position as the old one.\nReconnect any wires to the new heating element. Ensure everything is secured in place.\nCarefully reassemble all the parts in reverse order.\n\n\nHow to Inspect and Replace the Thermal Fuse on a Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer \nA thermal fuse is a safety device designed to prevent fires. It detects the temperature inside the dryer and will cut off the power if it overheats. This fuse is usually small and slender, colored white or metallic, and has two wires attached to it. You can often find it in the blower area. If this fuse \"blows\" or stops working, it disrupts the electricity going to the part of the dryer that heats up, causing the dryer not to heat as it should. This is what leads to the E64 error showing up. To replace the thermal fuse:\n\nMake sure the dryer is unplugged for safety.\nLocate the thermal fuse. It's often mounted on the blower housing or near the heating element. Depending on the dryer model, you might need to remove the back panel or the lower front panel.\nDisconnect the wires from the thermal fuse.\nSet a multimeter to the continuity setting.\nPlace the multimeter probes on each terminal of the thermal fuse. A good thermal fuse should show continuity. No continuity indicates a blown fuse.\nRemove the faulty thermal fuse by detaching it from its housing.\nInstall the new fuse by placing it in the same position and securing it.\nReconnect the wires to the new thermal fuse.\nCarefully reattach any panels or parts that were removed.\n\n\nHow to Inspect and Replace the Cycling Thermostat on a Frigidaire or Electrolux Dryer\nThe cycling thermostat in a dryer regulates the temperature inside the drum. It cycles on and off to maintain the desired temperature for drying clothes. This part usually looks like a small, round, metal device with a couple of wire connections, and sometimes it has a dial or disc you can see. You'll typically find it near the blower or along the path where air flows close to the drum. If this thermostat isn't working right, the dryer might get too hot or not heat up enough. You can test and replace the cycling thermostat by:\n\nMake sure the dryer is unplugged from its power source for safety.\nTake off the back panel (or another panel, depending on your dryer model).\nLook for the thermostat close to the blower housing.\nUse a multimeter on the ohms setting.\nCarefully remove the wires from the thermostat (remember where they go for later).\nTouch the multimeter probes to the thermostat's connectors. If it's working, the multimeter will show a continuous connection. No connection means it's probably broken.\nIf the thermostat is faulty, remove it by unscrewing or unclipping it from its housing.\nReattach the wires to the appropriate terminals on the new thermostat.\nReassemble the dryer by carefully reattaching any panels or parts that were removed.\n\n\nAddressing the E64 error is essential because without fixing it, your dryer won't heat up properly. If the code remains after trying these steps, or if you're hesitant about fixing it yourself, it's highly recommended to seek professional help for a safe and successful repair.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

However, this problem may also be caused by a clogged drain pump, a failed door latch/lid switch, a torn drive belt, a faulty pressure switch, or faulty water inlet valves. The sensing function on a Whirlpool washer detects the size of the laundry load and adjusts the amount of water in the washer accordingly. If your washer is stuck on this sensing cycle, it will be unable to advance through the rest of the cycles and clean your laundry. This guide will show you how to troubleshoot these faulty parts and get your washer running normally again.\n\nFaulty Whirlpool Washer Shift Actuator \nThe shift actuator is responsible for controlling the movement of the washer's agitator and spin basket during the wash cycle. It ensures that the washer switches between washing, spinning, and other cycles smoothly. If the shift actuator is faulty, it will be unable to move through the cycles and may leave your washer stuck on one cycle, such as the sensing cycle. You will need to replace the shift actuator to fix your washer.\n\nHow to Replace the Shift Actuator to Fix a Washer Stuck on Sensing\n\nEnsure the washer is unplugged from the electrical outlet to guarantee your safety while working on it. \nTurn off the water supply to the washer and disconnect the hoses. \nDepending on your model, there might be screws at the back or end caps that need to be removed to release the control panel.\nLift the control panel and locate the actuator. It's typically positioned near the motor. \nDisconnect any wires attached to the actuator, making a note of their positions for reassembly. \nRemove any mounting screws securing the actuator to the washer. \nInstall the new shift actuator in the same position and secure it with the mounting screws. \nReconnect the wires to the appropriate terminals. \nPut the control panel back in place and secure it with screws or clips. \nReconnect the water supply hoses. \nPlug the washer back in and run a test cycle to ensure that the new shift actuator is functioning correctly.\n \n\nClogged Whirlpool Washer Drain Pump\nThe drain pump is responsible for removing wastewater from your washing machine through the drain hose and into the drainpipe or washtub. If the drain pump is clogged, the washer cannot advance through its cycles, thus leaving your washer stuck on sensing. To fix this issue you will need to remove any obstructions that may be blocking the drain pump.\n\nHow To Access and Clean the Drain Pump in a Whirlpool Washer \n\nDisconnect your washing machine from the power outlet. \nDepending on your washer model, you may need to either remove the back panel of your washer to access your drain pump or you may need to remove the console and front panel. Check your user manual for the exact specifications. \nLocate the drain pump at the bottom of the washer, near the front or rear side, and place a bucket or towel underneath the pump area. \nDisconnect the hoses connected to the drain pump. It is normal for water to spill out at this point. \nRemove the mounting fasteners that secure the drain pump to the washer and pull it out. \nRemove and clean the pump filter if your model has one. Simply place it under warm rushing water to clear it of any debris. \nInspect the inside of the pump housing for any debris or small/loose items such as coins or buttons. \nInspect the pump impeller for any obstructions and ensure it can rotate freely. \nOnce you are done, place the filter back onto the pump and return it to the washer. \nSecure the pump in place and reattach the hoses.  \nReassemble your washer in reverse order and run a short cycle to check that your washer is now functioning properly. \n\n\nFaulty Whirlpool Washer Pressure Switch\nThe pressure switch helps to detect when the washer is sufficiently filled with water. It tells the control panel when it is time to start flushing out the water and tells the control board when the machine is empty, so that the spin cycle may begin. If the pressure switch experiences electrical issues or is physically damaged the washer will be unable to detect when it is time to advance to the next cycle. You will need to find a new pressure switch  to replace the faulty one.\n\nHow To Test and Replace the Pressure Switch in a Washer Stuck on Sensing\n\nUnplug your washer and turn off the water supply. \nLocate the pressure switch. It is typically found either under the control panel or under the top panel of your washer.  \nRemove the air pressure tube from the old pressure switch gently, using a pair of pliers. \nDisconnect the wire harness from the pressure switch and remove the screws holding the switch in place. \nInspect the switch for signs of damage and replace it if necessary. \nIf there is no damage, you should test the pressure switch for continuity. \nSet your multimeter to the lowest setting or “ohms” setting. \nConnect the prongs on your multimeter to the two outside terminals.  \nBlow into the hose to create pressure and check the reading on the meter. The reading should be close to “0”. If it is out of range, then the pressure switch will need to be replaced. \nTake your new pressure switch and place it in the same position as the old one. \nReconnect the wire harness and secure the switch using the mounting screws. \nReattach the air pressure tube and reassemble your washer. \n\n\nFaulty Whirlpool Washer Water Inlet Valve\nThe water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the washing machine drum. If the valves are damaged or faulty, they will be unable to carry out this function. Your washer may remain stuck on the sensing cycle because it is unable to adjust the water levels in the washer due to the failure of the water valves. Browse our selection of genuine Whirlpool OEM water inlet valves to find a new one for your washer. \n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Water Inlet Valve in a Washer Stuck on Sensing\n\n\nDisconnect the washing machine from the electrical outlet, and turn off the water supply.\nPull the washing machine away from the wall.\nDisconnect the water hoses from the back of the washing machine.\nRemove the rear panel of the washer and disconnect the wiring from the faulty water inlet valve.\nRemove the mounting fasteners holding the valve in place, and carefully pull it out of the washer.  \nMount the new valve in place and secure it using the appropriate screws.\nReconnect the wiring to the new valve and reassemble the washer in reverse order.\nReconnect the water hoses to the new valve, and ensure each hose is in the right position.\nRestore the power to your washer and check whether it is properly functioning.\n\n\n\nFaulty Door Latch\nThe door latch is responsible for keeping the washer door shut. When the door is closed, it engages with the strike, which communicates to the washer that it is safe to begin a cycle. If the door is unable to stay closed or communicate that it is closed, your washer may stop mid-cycle or fail to start altogether. You can explore our genuine OEM Whirlpool door latches here.\n\nHow to Replace the Door Latch to Fix a Washer Stuck on Sensing\n\nDisconnect the washer from the power outlet.\nOpen the washer door and carefully peel the door boot off the washer frame.\nUndo the mounting fasteners that hold the door latch in place. If it is damaged, it will need to be replaced. \nIf there is no visible damage, use a multimeter to test the switch for potential electrical failure. \nIf you find that the latch should be replaced, simply discard the old one and position the new one over the mounting holes. \nReconnect the wire harness and secure the new latch in place. \nRemember to return the door boot to the washer before closing the door to test that the latch is functional.\n\n\nFaulty Whirlpool Washer Lid Switch\nThe lid switch is a safety mechanism found under the washer lid that. It is responsible for ensuring that the washer lid is securely shut so that the wash cycle can begin. If the lid switch is damaged or faulty the washer may not start, spin, drain or it may remain stuck on the sensing cycle, unable to advance. You will need to find a new pressure switch to replace the faulty one.\n\nHow to Replace the Lid Switch in a Washer Stuck on Sensing\n\nDisconnect the washer from the power outlet.\nTake a putty knife and slide it under the top panel of the washer to release the clips the hold the lid in position.\nCarefully pull the top panel up and rest it against the washer.\nDisconnect the wiring harness. It may be helpful to take an image of how the wires are routed for reinstallation later.\nInspect the switch for any physical damage and test the switch for continuity using a multimeter. \nOnce you have established that the switch needs to be replaced, you can remove it from the washer and discard it. \nPlace the new switch on the underside of the cabinet and secure it with the appropriate fasteners.\nReattach the wiring harness using your image from earlier.\nReturn the top panel of the cabinet to the washer.\nReconnect the washer to the power outlet and check that it is now working.\n\n\nFaulty Whirlpool Washer Drive Belt \nThe drive belt is a thin rubber strip that connects the motor to the drum, allowing it to spin. If the belt is frayed, loose or broken, it will be unable to transfer the power from the motor to the drum. The drum may not spin at all or become stuck on a cycle. You will need to replace the drive belt to restore your washer's functions.How to Replace the Drive Belt in a Washer Stuck on Sensing\n\nUnplug the washer from the power source, and turn off the water supply to the washer.\nDisconnect the water supply hoses from the back of the washer. \nRemove the fasteners along the back panel of the washer and pull the panel off.\nInspect the drive belt to verify whether it is in good condition. Replace the belt if it can no longer maintain tension or it is visibly cracked. \nRotate the tub drive pulley to release the old belt.\nLoop the new belt around the motor pulley and place the other end on the tub drive pulley. Ensure that the grooved side is facing inwards.\nRotate the tub drive pulley to secure the new drive belt.\nReassemble the washer in reverse order and reconnect the water supply hoses.\n\n\nHow to Reset Your Whirlpool Washer\nYour washer may be stuck on the sensing cycle due to a control board error. If you have tried the steps above and your washer is still not working you can follow the steps below to reset your washer.\n\nDisconnect the washing machine from the power outlet. To perform a hard reset, you can also turn it off at the circuit breaker. \nLeave the washing machine unplugged for 3 - 5 minutes.\nReconnect the washer to the power outlet and turn it on at the circuit breaker. \nRun a short cycle to check that the washer is now working. If you would like more detailed instructions on how to reset your washer, follow our Whirlpool reset guide.\n\n\nWe know how frustrating it can be when you can't do your laundry. Following the guide above should help you to fix your washer and allow it to advance past the sensing cycle. Remember, regular maintenance and cleaning will help keep your Whirlpool washer running efficiently for many more years. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

But knowing which type of reset to do, and how to perform one, are vital to fixing your oven and getting it back to working properly as soon as possible!\n\nWhy You Need to Reset a Samsung Oven\nWhy you would need to reset your Samsung oven is ultimately a subjective thing. But typically if you're experiencing issues using your oven and/or an error code has appeared on its display, or if there has recently been a power outage and your oven is not responding, then you would need to reset it.\n\nCommon Samsung Oven Error Codes that are Resolved by a Reset\nThe following is a list of error codes than appear across a wide range of the Samsung oven models, which may/may not appear the same for your model, but will ultimately still be fixable with a reset.\n\n\nbAd: This code indicates a loose power connection, whether at the wall outlet or the oven itself. If a reset doesn't fix this code, you will need to contact technical support and/or perform your own repair.\nCtoP: This code acts as a temporary warning about the cooktop being in use during a self clean. Ensure all burners are shut off before resetting your range and attempting another self-clean.\nSE: If you see this code, it means there's an issue with the control board of the oven. If a reset of the whole appliance does not fix this code, you will need to replace the control board.\ndoor: Seeing this code signifies a door closure issue, and if you're sure the door is shut completely, perform a quick reset.\n\n\nHow Do You Reset a Samsung Oven?\nResetting a Samsung oven can be done in of two ways; with a soft or hard reset. Knowing which to perform, and how to perform them is dependant upon the specific model, but they all generally follow the same steps.\n\nHow to Soft Reset Your Samsung Oven\n\n\nTo reset a Samsung oven, first locate the designated 'Reset' button on your Samsung oven.\nHold the 'Reset' button, or specific reset controls for 5-10 seconds.\nIf this does not perform a reset initially, check your model's user manual for more specific instructions regarding a reset with the oven controls.\n\n\n\nHow to Hard Reset Your Samsung Oven\n\n\nFirst, locate the circuit breaker fuse responsible for the oven, or the kitchen as a whole.\nTurn off the power for your oven's outlet or its section of your kitchen.\nOnce the power is cut, leave it off for 5-10 minutes, before restoring it.\nIf your oven doesn't work properly after a hard reset, you may need to replace a specific part, or need to contact Samsung customer support.\n\n\n\nSamsung Oven is Reset But Still Not Working\nIf your Samsung oven is still having issues even after a soft and/or hard reset, your best course of action is to find out what exactly is causing the issues within your oven. The first thing to do is to use your oven like normal, and taking note of any activity that's different; not reaching the correct temperature (verify with thermometer), taking far too long to preheat, touchpad or oven itself stops responding. Using that information can assist you in figuring out which specific part is the cause for your issues.\n\nAddtionally, are you seeing any error codes, or noticing any errors popping up when trying to use the oven normally? Looking for the error codes you're seeing on your Samsung oven's display in your user manual will give you an clearer indication of what is going on internally, and help you to get the OEM parts you need to repair your oven quicker.\n\nNow, if you're at this point, hopefully you've performed a soft and/or hard reset of your Samsung oven, to great success! If your oven is still not functioning properly, it will likely need a replacement of the control board, temperature sensor, or touchpad. Fortunately, we have a wide range of OEM Samsung oven/range parts for whichever model you may have!\n\nRemember, PartSelect has all of the parts you need for the appliances and tools you use every day!

It may be something as trivial as needing to replace its air filter or cleaning the A/C itself, but when it flashes and doesn't respond or start up, it's normally a part-related issue like the temperature sensor and/or control board. But worry not, all of the information you need to help you figure out the issue at hand is here!\n\nWhat Does '88' Mean on GE Air Conditioners?\n\nThe '88' that displays on certain GE air conditioner models does not have a direct meaning or specific error behind it, but merely means that there is something not working properly within the air conditioner's system. It's important to note that if your home experiences a power surge or outage, an '88' will likely appear on the display when you turn it on next, and it's not inherently a bad thing. But if your A/C stops working or flashes and beeps with '88' on its display, there are some things you can do to fix it.\n\nFix GE Air Conditioner Code 88 with a Soft Reset\nThe very first thing you can do to fix a GE air conditioner that's flashing '88' is to perform a soft reset. Depending on your air conditioner model this may appear differently, but simply pressing the 'Reset' button or the series of buttons specific to your model will reset the appliance.\n\nFix GE Air Conditioner Code 88 with a Hard Reset\nIf a soft reset doesn't fix the issues you're having with your GE air conditioner, disconnecting it from power for 5-10 minutes performs a hard reset and may fix issues that a soft reset couldn't. When you do this, you can also use a voltage tester to check whether the wall outlet is outputting a consistent level of electricity.\n\nHow to Replace Parts to Solve GE AC 88 Code\nIf you've performed a hard and soft reset on your GE air conditioner, and it's still not working as it should, you'll be looking to replace a part or two; the parts that have a tendency to end up causing problems are the air filter, the temperature sensor, and the control board(s).\n\nHow to Replace GE Air Conditioner Filter\nReplacing or cleaning an air conditioner's filter is something that can fix issues you may be having with your air conditioner's performance, which can lead to further issues if not taken care of beforehand. The location of your model's filter will be specific to that model, and may vary. It's important to clean it every 30 days if possible, or depending on your use of the appliance. If your air conditioner's filter is damaged, broken, or simply in need of replacing, you can find a new OEM filter at PartSelect.com!\n\nSome do's and don'ts regarding the cleaning and replacing of your air filter:\nDon't: Install a filter that may be damp or even a little moist. Make sure it is clean and dry upon installation.\nDon't: Clean your filter aggressively with a brush. Filters like this must be cleaned gently by hand or soft-bristle brush, and cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher.\nDon't: Use your air conditioner without a filter. Ensure an air filter is in place before you turn the air conditioner on.\nDo: Vacuum the air filter gently with a brush attachment before washing it in water.\nDo: Use detergent to get out any excessive dirt in the filter.\nDo: Handle the filter with care. Any tears or cuts in the filter will render it ineffective.\n\nHow to Replace GE Air Conditioner Temperature Sensor\nThermistors, a type of temperature sensor, are a type of thermally sensitive resistor that detects small, incremental changes in the surrounding temperature by way of resistance to temperature variations. These sensors can short and just stop working properly, and cause many issues for the appliances you use, like your GE air conditioner. You can find a new OEM sensor for your GE air conditioner on PartSelect, and read the general guide below to find out how to replace it.\n\n\n\nUnplug your air conditioner from the wall outlet.\nUnthread any securing screws keeping the air conditioner seated in its window position, if necessary.\nDisconnect and remove the front grille, which may require a screwdriver.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the control panel and front of your air conditioner, to gain access to its interior.\nRemove the front panel and any other panels covering the interior components.\nOnce you have access to the interior, locate the sensor and disconnect it. The sensor will appear as a mounted wire attached to the control board. Reference your user manual for further assistance.\nWith the old sensor removed, install the new sensor.\nResecure the front panel and any other panels that were removed, including the control board.\nResecure the front grille and seat the air conditioner back into position.\nConnect the air conditioner to power and turn it on to test.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace GE Air Conditioner Control Board\nIf your GE air conditioner is flashing an '88' error code and/or is simply not turning on or working properly, the ultimate culprit is a faulty or shorted control board. Control boards can stop working for a multitude of reasons, especially if your appliance is an older model. Fortunately, PartSelect has a wide-range of new OEM control boards for whichever GE air conditioner model you may have, and the guide you need to assist you in replacing it!\n\n\n\nUnplug your air conditioner, remove it from its position, and set it on a sturdy surface.\nRemove the air filter and front grille.\nUnthread and remove the cabinet of the air conditioner to gain access to its interior components.\nLocate the control board and take note of its wire arrangement.\nDisconnect all of the connected wires.\nRemove the old control board and unscrew it from its housing if necessary.\nInstall the new control board, within its housing too, if necessary.\nSecure the new control board within the air conditioner.\nConnect the appropriate wires to the control board.\nOnce the control board is secured and wired appropriately, reconnect the cabinet of the air conditioner.\nReconnect the air filter and front grille.\nReseat the air conditioner back into position and plug it in to its power outlet to test.\n\n\n\nHopefully at this point, your GE air conditioner is now working again! However, if you find that your air conditioner is still not working properly and you're seeing '88's pop-up, the best option may be to contact General Electric for a warranty repair or replacement. Or if your A/C is outside of its warranty period, perhaps you should begin exploring options for a new air conditioner!\n\nJust remember that PartSelect's wide range of OEM parts is the hub for any and all repairs you may have, for the appliances you use most!

But even though it's a frequent issue for Samsung dryers, you can easily fix it with a quick reset of the dryer itself, or a replacement of its thermostats, moisture sensors, or heating element. All you need are some tools, a step-by-step guide (like this one), and some DIY repair time!\n\nWhy is Your Samsung Dryer Not Heating Properly?\nThere are several reasons why a Samsung dryer stops heating properly, and as a result, the clothes within it do not come out dry. This could be as a result of something as simple as buildups in the lint screen or exhaust vent, which can create overheat the dryer itself and cause components like the heating element and moisture sensors to fail.\n\nSamsung Dryer Error Codes\nIf your Samsung dryer isn't heating properly, the following error codes can appear and will each have their own issue that needs fixing:\n\n\ntS, t5, tC, tO, t0, tE, tE3, tC5, tCS, 1 tC, 1tC5, 1tCS: These all indicate a temperature issue from the sensors that measure it (normally a clogged lint screen or exhaust vent). Cleaning those areas can dismiss this code.\nHC, hE, HC4, 1 HC: These codes indicate an extreme heat level within the dryer, which is likely from trapped heat as a result of a clog. Cleaning the lint filter and/or exhaust vent can eliminate this code.\n\n\nOr your dryer not heating properly can be a result of a failed thermostat, which can fail and sometimes are designed to stop components like the heating element from functioning. No matter the cause, however, the answers you need to fix your Samsung dryer are below!\n\nHow to Reset a Samsung Dryer to Resolve Heating Issues\nSometimes a simple reset is all an appliance needs to get back and working properly again, and this is the same case with a Samsung dryer!\n\n\nFirst, look for a 'Reset' button or reference your user manual for a button combination to reset your dryer.\nHold the button(s) for 5-10 seconds, or as long as it takes to fully reset the appliance.\nOnce the dryer is reset, run a short test cycle.\nIf the dryer is not heating, unplug or turn off the outlet for the dryer from the circuit breaker.\nLeave your dryer off for 5-10 minutes.\nReconnect your dryer to power and attempt another test cycle.\nIf the dryer is still not heating, continue with this guide.\n\n\nHow to Clean a Samsung Dryer Vent to Resolve Heating Issues\nIf a simple soft and hard reset of your dryer does not fix its lack of heating ensure that the lint in your lint trap/filter is cleaned. This is exactly how to clean it, and make sure that as much lint as possible is removed.\n\n\nFirst, disconnect your dryer from its wall outlet.\nOpen your dryer door and locate the lint screen/filter.\nRemove the lint screen/filter and clean it completely.\nDepending on your model, you may be able to remove the lint screen holder. If you can, remove it and vacuum and clean the inside of the dryer cabinet.\nReassemble your lint screen assembly, and locate the exhaust vent on your dryer.\nRemove the exhaust vent hose and use a brush to remove excess lint on the inside of the hose and the dryer exhaust vent.\nUse a vacuum to clean the inside of both the vent hose and exhaust.\nRemove excess lint from the exhaust outside of your home.\n\n\nWhat Parts to Replace if Samsung Dryer is Not Heating\nIf your Samsung dryer is continuing to not heat properly, and cleaning excess lint or resetting it aren't helping to restore it to working order, you're now looking at replacing one (or potentially multiple) parts. No matter the complexity of the part you have to replace, we have the step-by-step guides for each, and a wide range of OEM Samsung dryer parts for you to choose from!\n\nHow to Replace a Samsung Dryer Thermostat to Fix Heating Issues\nOne of the main components that can become problematic with a Samsung dryer's ability to heat up properly is their thermostat. Thermostats regulate the internal temperature of the dryer drum, and can fail for various reasons like a clogged lint screen or vents, or even a shorted heating element. As prone as they are to failing, we have the OEM Samsung dryer thermostat you need, and the step-by-step guide to show you how to replace it!\n\n\nFirst, disconnect your dryer from the wall outlet.\nOnce your dryer is disconnected from power, unthread the screws securing the top panel.\nSlide off the top panel of the dryer.\nCarefully lift and pop-out each tab securing the front control board panel to the dryer.\nLift the control board panel away from the dryer, and disconnect the wire harnesses. Take pictures of where wires are for reassembly later.\nOpen your dryer door.\nLocate the screws within the door frame, and unthread each one.\nWith those screws removed, unthread the screws at the top of the door frame, under where the control board panel was.\nRelease the pressure tabs to allow the front panel of the dryer to come off.\nDisconnect any wire harnesses on the inner portion of the front panel.\nRemove the front panel.\nLocate the thermostat underneath the dryer drum.\nIf you can't remove the screws that secure the thermostat without removing the drum, the drum will need to be removed.\nTo remove the drum in your Samsung dryer, you will need to disengage the belt around the idler pulley. This may require you to pull your dryer out of its spot and remove the back panel to gain access to the belt.\nOnce the dryer drum is removed and/or you have access to the thermostat, unthread its securing screws and remove it.\nYou can now test the thermostat if you'd like. With a multimeter, set it to the RX 1 setting and place each probe on a terminal. If you see a number close to 0, it means it's still working. However, if it reads infinity or a number above 0, it needs replacing.\nInstall the new thermostat in the same way the original one was installed.\nReplace the drum in the dryer, and install the belt.\nReconnect the front panel and any wire harnesses to it.\nThread the screws into the top portion of the front panel, and into the door frame.\nReconnect the control board panel and its wire harnesses.\nPlace the top panel of the dryer back on, and thread the screws securing it.\nConnect your dryer to the wall outlet, and run quick test cycle.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Samsung Dryer Cut-Off Thermostat to Fix Heating Issues\nIf replacing the thermostat in your Samsung dryer does not solve your dryer heating issues, replacing your dryer's cut off thermostat should. The cut-off thermostat, also known as a hi-limit thermostat, is a preventative safety device that automatically turns off the heating element or dryer itself if the internal temperature of the dryer becomes too hot. Removing and installing a new cut-off thermostat requires an OEM Samsung dryer cut-off thermostat which you can find in our huge part catalogue, and a step-by-step guide showing you how to do it.\n\n\nFirst, make sure your dryer is unplugged.\nRemove the screws that hold the top panel and slide it carefully off the dryer.\nPry away the tabs attaching the front control board panel.\nDisconnect any wire harnesses connected to the control board panel. And take pictures of the wire connections during this repair for easier reassembly later.\nOpen the dryer door and unscrew the screws on the inside of the door and at the top of the front panel.\nPush the tabs to release the panel, and again disconnect any wire harnesses to remove it.\nNow you will need to disengage the belt on the idler pulley to remove the drum, which will likely require you to remove the back panel of the dryer.\nOnce the idler pulley is disengaged, remove the drum from the dryer carefully.\nLocate the cut-off thermostat near the blower assembly, and disconnect its wire harness.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread the securing screw(s) holding the thermostat.\nNow, you can remove the thermostat and test it for continuity.\nUsing a multimeter, set it to RX 1 (or the lowest Ohm's setting) and touch the probes to the terminals on the thermostat.\nIf it reads zero, or close to it, the thermostat is still working and has not shorted or been used.\nIf the meter is showing infinity or nothing at all, it's been used or is defective.\nInstall the new (or current) thermostat.\nReplace the dryer drum, and engage the belt on the idler pulley.\nConnect the front panel back on the dryer.\nSecure the front panel screws within the door frame and on top of it.\nReconnect the control board panel and secure it with its wire harnesses.\nPlace the top panel on again, and secure it with its screws.\nConnect your dryer to power, and run a test cycle.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Samsung Dryer Moisture Sensor to Fix Heating Issues\nThe moisture sensor in a Samsung dryer is ultimately responsible for detecting the moisture level within the dryer drum, and adjusting the time it'll take to dry the clothes. If this sensor is shorted, defective, or simply not working properly anymore, it will result in your dryer incorrectly detecting the proper level of moisture, and will likely result in it over-heating, or in this case, not heating enough. Luckily, you can find an OEM Samsung dryer moisture sensor that works for your model at PartSelect, and the guide on how to replace it below!\n\n\nUnplug your dryer from the wall outlet, and unthread the top cover panel.\nRemove the top panel by sliding it off, and then remove the screws or tabs securing the front control board panel. Take pictures of any wire harnesses for reassembly later.\nLift up on the control board panel and disconnect its wire harnesses.\nUnthread the screws holding the door, and remove the screws in the door frame and front panel.\nLift up on the front panel and disconnect any wire harnesses to remove it.\nRemove the lint filter and the screws securing its assembly.\nLocate the moisture sensor near the door frame, and use a set of pliers (if necessary) to remove the wires connected to it.\nRemove the lint filter assembly, and locate the sensor(s). Use a set of pliers, if necessary, to bend the sensors straight and remove them.\nTo install the new sensor(s), place them in the position of the previous sensor(s), and firmly push them in until they snap into place.\nUsing pliers, if necessary, to secure the sensor(s).\nReassemble the lint filter assembly, and install it back into the dryer.\nConnect the wire harness to the moisture sensors.\nThread the securing screws into the lint filter assembly, and insert the filter itself.\nReconnect the front panel and connect any wire harnesses necessary.\nConnect the door again, and its securing screws.\nThread the screws into the front panel and door frame of the dryer.\nConnect the control board panel again, and its wire harnesses.\nSlide the top panel back into position, and screw it back.\nPlug your dryer back into the wall outlet, and run a test cycle on your dryer.\n\n\nHow to Replace a Samsung Dryer Heating Element to Fix Heating Issues\nIf your Samsung dryer is experiencing heating issues, the be-all end-all part to replace is the heating element, which may be the first and only part you have to replace, or the last. The heating element is designed to convert electrical energy from the wall outlet into heat, which is necessary for the drying process of your dryer cycle. Most heating elements are coils that becomes hot when an electrical current runs through it. If the thermostats in your dryer have already been replaced, then the heating element is the only other part that could be replaced to fix a heating issue. All you need to replace the heating element in your Samsung dryer is a new OEM heating element, a screwdriver and some needle-nose pliers, and the following general guide to assist you during this repair.\n\n\nDisconnect your dryer from the wall outlet.\nUnthread the screws securing the top panel of your dryer.\nSlide the top panel of the dryer off, and pop out the pressure tabs of the control board panel if applicable. Make sure to take note of any wires and what they're connected to for reassembly later.\nUnthread any necessary screws keeping the front door in place.\nUnthread any screws on the front and top of the front panel, and disconnect any wire harnesses.\nOnce the front panel is loose, carefully lift and remove it.\nUndo any wire harnesses.\nUnthread and remove any panels covering the dryer drum.\nDisengage the belt on the idler pulley. This may require you to remove the back panel of your dryer.\nOnce the belt is disengaged, carefully lift the drum out of the dryer.\nNow that you have access to the heating element, use a multimeter and set it to Ohm's or RX 1 and touch each probe to the terminals on the element - not the thermostats.\nIf the reading is on or around zero, it does not need to be replaced. However, if the reading is infinity or not zero at all - it needs replacing.\nRemove the wires from the terminals on the heating element with needle-nose pliers, and disconnect it using a screwdriver.\nReplace the old heating element with the new, and install the screws and wires.\nCarefully place the drum back in the dryer, and engage the belt with the idler pulley.\nReplace any panels on the front of the drum, and install the front panel and its wire harnesses.\nThread the securing screws into the front panel, on top and in front.\nSecure the door back in place.\nReplace the control board panel in front if applicable, and connect the necessary wires.\nSlide the top panel back on the dryer and secure it.\nPlug your dryer back into the wall outlet, and run a short test cycle.\n\n\nNow that you've hopefully fixed your Samsung dryer and have it heating up properly, you can get back to having warm, dry clothes!

Learn how to identify and address these problems with easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions.\n\nCommon Reasons Your Amana Washer Isn't Spinning\nIf your Amana washer isn't spinning, there are steps that you can take to troubleshoot it:\n\nLoad Size and Balance: If your washer is packed to the brim or the clothes are all huddled on one side, it can slow down spin speeds. Try to even out your laundry load and keeping the drum to a comfortable three-quarters full.\nDetergent Choice: Using excessive detergent, especially non-HE (High Efficiency) detergent in HE washers, can create too much suds which make it tough for your washer to spin properly. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended detergent dosage.\nOpen Lid: Check that the lid is closed and latched. Once the lid is properly secured, your washer should resume its normal operation and enter the spin cycle.\nMechanical Failures: Various parts can malfunction and cause your washer to stop spinning. These parts include the lid switch, drive belt, and motor coupling.\n\n\nHow to Fix Your Amana Washer That Isn't Spinning\nIf your washer continues to have spinning issues, it may be linked to particular parts:\n\nSafety Precautions\nAlways disconnect your washer from its power source before starting any repair work. Read your washer's manual carefully for specific safety guidelines and instructions to prevent any injury or damage to the appliance.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Lid Switch in an Amana Washer\nThe lid switch is a safety feature designed to stop your Amana washer from running when the lid is open. It's a small plastic device with electrical contacts, typically situated near the lid or door frame. When the lid is closed, the switch activates, allowing the machine to operate. However, if the lid switch malfunctions, the washer might mistakenly think the lid is open and won't start spinning.\n\n\nRemove Panels and Wires: Depending on your model, the lid lock might be accessible from the top or behind the front panel. Use the nut driver to remove the access panel and the upper back panel. Release the wiring harness from the control panel.\nAccess the Switch: Slide the top panel back and forth gently until it unlocks, revealing the lid switch assembly.\nTest for Continuity: Set your multimeter to the lowest ohms of resistance setting. Touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the lid switch. If the multimeter does not read any continuity, the lid switch is faulty and needs replacement.\nReplace the Switch: Use the screwdriver to release the lid switch assembly. Unscrew the mounting screws, remove the old assembly, and install the new one, ensuring it clicks into place.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drive Belt in an Amana Washer\nThe drive belt, usually a rubber loop with ribs or grooves, connects the motor to the drum or transmission. It transfers the motor's rotational power to spin the drum. If the belt is broken or excessively worn, it can't transfer this power, causing the washer to fail to spin.\n\n\nAccess the Belt: In top-load washers, the belt is at the bottom, connecting the transmission to the drive motor. In front-load washers, it's usually at the rear, connecting the motor to the wash basket.\nRemove the Belt: Gently tilt the washing machine backward, laying it on the floor. Remove the motor shield and belt cover. Carefully slide the old belt off the transmission and motor pulleys\nInspect the Belt: A drive belt needs replacement if it has noticeable fraying, cracks, looseness, or a burnt rubber smell.\nReplace the Belt: Clean off the transmission and motor pulleys. Loop the new belt around the motor pulley first, then around the transmission pulley. Make sure the belt is centered, with the grooved side facing inwards, and is properly tensioned.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Motor Coupling in an Amana Washer\nThe motor coupling connects the motor to the transmission.  It usually consists of two plastic pieces joined by a rubber coupling. It transfers power from the motor to the drum. If the coupling is broken, the washer may fill and drain but won't spin, as the motor's power isn't reaching the drum. A damaged motor coupler can produce unusual sounds like grinding or rattling during the washer's operation.\n\n\nDisassemble the Washer: Start by taking off the control panel. You'll find mounting screws either at the front, bottom, or back of the panel. Locate the lid switch wire harness under the control panel and disconnect it. Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the spring clips that secure the washer's body to the frame. Then, tilt and lift off the washer body at a 45-degree angle.\nAccess the Coupling: At the bottom of the washer, find the pump held by two clips. Remove these with a flathead screwdriver and set the pump aside. Remove the electrical connection from the motor, then unfasten the nuts holding the motor clips. Support the motor from the bottom while doing this.\nRemove the Coupling: Pry the old coupler off the motor and transmission shafts using a claw hammer or a flathead screwdriver.\nInspect the Coupling: The motor may appear cracked, worn out, or broken. You might find chunks of rubber beneath the washer, which are pieces of the coupler's isolator breaking apart, indicating a damaged coupler\nReplace the Coupling: Align the new coupler with the flat portions of the shafts and gently tap it into place, ensuring it's secure on both the motor and transmission shafts.\n\n\nWorking with appliance parts can be complex. If you're not confident in your ability to perform these steps, or if you've tried and still face spinning issues, it's a good idea to contact a professional technician for expert assistance. They can provide a thorough diagnosis and resolve any underlying issues with your Amana washer.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

In this article, we'll explore these common issues, as well as several others. It's no secret that a malfunctioning freezer can quickly disrupt your daily routines and jeopardize the preservation of all your food. By understanding the causes of the problem and using the simple troubleshooting techniques laid out here you can swiftly restore your Frigidaire freezer to optimal performance, and ensure your frozen goods remain as fresh as ever. \n\nDirty Condenser Coils\nThe condenser coils play an important role in your freezer by releasing heat from the appliance into the surrounding air. If the condenser coils are dirty or covered in dust, they will be unable to disperse this heat effectively, leading to higher temperatures inside your freezer. It is important to regularly clean the condenser coils to ensure that they continue to run efficiently. \n\nHow to Clean the Condenser Coils to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nBefore starting any repairs or maintenance, unplug the freezer to ensure your safety.\nIf the coils are located on the back of the freezer, you may need to pull the freezer away from the wall for better access.\nFor freezers with coils on the back, they are usually visible once you remove the back panel. If the coils are underneath, you might need to remove a grille or kick plate to access them.\nUse a soft brush, such as a refrigerator coil brush to gently remove the dust and debris from the coils.\nIf there is still any remaining dirt, you can use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to carefully suck away the dirt. Ensure the vacuum is set on a low suction setting to avoid damaging the appliance.\nOnce the coils are clean and you've checked for any other issues, reassemble the freezer by putting back the panels, grille, or kick plate.\nPlug the freezer back in or turn on the power source.\nAllow the freezer some time to cool down, and then check that the temperature is now at the desired level.\n\n\n\nFaulty Door Gasket\nThe door gasket is an airtight seal that runs along the perimeter of the freezer door. It prevents cold air from escaping while keeping warm air from entering. A faulty door gasket will result in temperature fluctuations and inadequate cooling. If the door gasket is torn or no longer sticking to the door, you will need to  replace the door gasket to restore your Frigidaire freezer. \n\nHow to Replace the Door Gasket to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nOpen the freezer door and carefully peel back the old gasket from the edge of the door.\nWipe the area around the door with a soft cloth or sponge and mild soapy water to remove any dirt or residue.\nAlign the new gasket along the edge of the door, making sure it matches the orientation of the old one.\nPress the gasket firmly into place to ensure a tight seal.\nClose the freezer door and check for any gaps or areas where the gasket may not be sealing properly, and adjust as needed. \n\n\n\nTemperature Control Thermostat \nThe thermostat regulates the temperature inside the freezer by sending signals to the compressor about when to start and stop cooling. If the thermostat is malfunctioning, it may not signal the compressor to start when necessary, leading to inadequate cooling. You will need to inspect the thermostat for signs of damage or test it for continuity. If it has failed, you will need to  replace the thermostat to restore your freezer. You can usually locate it inside the freezer compartment, near the top, or on the side.\n\nHow to Test the Thermostat with a Multimeter\n\n\nDisconnect the freezer from the power outlet before beginning.\nRemove any food items/containers and shelves to ensure you have unobstructed access to the thermometer.\nLocate the thermostat and if it has a cover, carefully remove it.\nInspect the thermostat for signs of damage. If any are present, it will need to be replaced. If not, test the thermostat for continuity.\nTake a picture or note down how the thermostat wires are routed and connected.\nGently disconnect the wires.\nTurn on your multimeter and set it to the \"Ohms\" setting.\nTouch the multimeter probes to the terminals on the thermostat. If there is no continuity, then it is likely faulty and needs replacement.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Thermostat to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nWith the wires already disconnected, remove the thermostat from its mounting bracket.\nPlace the new thermostat into the mounting bracket in the same position as the old one and secure it in place with the appropriate hardware.\nReconnect the wires to the new thermostat and refer to your picture or notes to ensure they are correctly positioned.\nPlace and secure the thermostat cover.\nPut back any shelves or storage bins you removed earlier.\nReconnect the freezer to the power outlet.\nSet the temperature to the desired level and monitor the freezer to ensure it is cooling properly.\n\n\n\nStart Relay \nThe start relay is a small rectangular or cylindrical component on the side of the compressor. It boosts electrical power to the compressor to allow it to start running. A faulty start relay can prevent the compressor from starting, leading to cooling issues. If the start relay is malfunctioning you may hear unusual clicking sounds coming from the compressor area, or notice frequent cycling of the compressor without proper cooling. Inspect the start relay for damage and test it for continuity. If it is faulty, replace the start relay to restore your Frigidaire freezer. \n\nHow to Test the Start Relay with a Multimeter\n\n\nDisconnect the freezer from the power outlet for your safety.\nRemove the access panel covering the compressor and start relay.\nLocate the start relay on the side of the compressor and take a picture of how the wires are routed.\nDisconnect the wire harness that connects the start relay to the compressor. \nRefer to your user manual or the wiring diagram to correctly identify which terminals to test.\nTurn on your multimeter and set it to the \"Ohms\" setting.\nTouch the multimeter probes to the appropriate terminals and check for continuity. \nIf the start relay is defective, replace it using the instructions below.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Start Relay to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nRemove the mounting hardware that is holding the start relay to the compressor.\nDiscard the old relay and position the new one inside the appliance.\nRefer to your image from earlier and connect the wire harness to the new relay.\nSecure the new start relay in place using clips or screws.\nReattach the access panel and secure it in place.\nPlug the freezer back into the power source.\nAllow the freezer some time to cool and confirm that the compressor is once again running smoothly. \n\n\n\nCondenser Fan Motor \nThe condenser fan motor blows air over the condenser coils, helping to release the heat absorbed from the interior of the freezer. The condenser fan helps cool the refrigerant, and if it's not working, then the freezer may not freeze. Check for any obstructions that might be preventing the fan from turning. If the fan motor is faulty, use our model search feature to find the right  replacement condenser fan motor.\n\nHow to Replace the Condenser Fan Motor to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nDisconnect the freezer from the power source. \nLocate the condenser fan motor. It is typically situated near the compressor at the back of the freezer.\nUsing a screwdriver or appropriate tool, remove the back panel covering the condenser fan motor.\nIdentify the wires connected to the condenser fan motor. Take note of their positions or take a picture for reference.\nCarefully disconnect the wires from the motor.\nLocate and remove the mounting screws that secure the condenser fan motor to the freezer.\nIf the fan blade is attached to the motor, carefully detach it. This is often done by removing a retaining nut or clip.\nPlace the new condenser fan motor in the same position as the old one and reattach the fan blade if necessary. \nUse the mounting screws to secure the new motor in place.\nReconnect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new motor. Refer to your earlier notes or picture for guidance.\nPut the back panel back in its place and secure it with screws.\nPlug the freezer back into the power source.\nTurn on the freezer and check that the new condenser fan motor operates smoothly and that the freezer starts cooling properly.\n\n\n\nEvaporator Fan Motor \nThe evaporator fan circulates air over the evaporator coils, which causes the refrigerant to absorb heat from the freezer. This process is essential for cooling the interior of the freezer and keeping all your food items at the right temperature. If it fails, the freezer may not cool or freeze properly. Use our model search feature to find the right  replacement evaporator fan motor for your freezer.\n\nHow to Replace the Evaporator Fan Motor to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nDisconnect the freezer from the power outlet.\nOpen the freezer door and remove any food items or shelves. The evaporator fan motor is usually located in the freezer compartment, either behind the back panel or near the evaporator coils. .\nUnscrew the screws securing the back panel using a screwdriver.\nLocate the evaporator fan motor and take an image of how the wires are connected for installation later.\nDisconnect the wiring harness. Use needle-nose pliers if necessary.\nRemove any screws or clips securing the fan motor in place.\nGently pull out the old evaporator fan motor from its housing.\nPlace the new evaporator fan motor into the housing. Secure the motor with the screws or clips you removed earlier.\nConnect the wiring harness to the new evaporator fan motor using your image for reference.\nPut the back panel back in place and secure it with the screws. Reinstall any shelves that were removed.\nPlug the freezer back in.\nAllow the freezer some time to cool, and then check if the new evaporator fan motor is functioning properly.\n\n\n\nControl Board \nThe control board communicates with various freezer components and sensors to control the functions of the freezer. If it malfunctions, it may lead to difficulties regulating the temperature or controlling the fans and motors, resulting in cooling problems. Check for visible signs of damage on the control board. If any are present, you will need to replace the control board.\n\nHow to Replace the Control Board to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer\n\n\nUnplug the freezer from the power source.\nRefer to your user manual to locate the control board. It is typically found at the bottom of your appliance, towards either the front or rear end.\nRemove any covers/panels that conceal the control board.\nBefore disconnecting any wires, take a picture of the current wiring setup. This will help you reconnect everything correctly later.\nGently disconnect the wires from the control board.\nUnscrew the old control board from its mounting brackets, and discard it.\nAlign the new control board with the mounting brackets.\nSecure the board in place using the screws you removed earlier.\nRefer to the picture you took earlier to reconnect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new control board.\nReattach any covers or panels you removed to access the control board and secure them back in place.\nPlug the freezer back into the power source.\n\n\n\nFaulty Compressor\nThe compressor is the heart of the cooling system in your freezer. If the compressor is not functioning, the freezer won't cool. The compressor may fail due to electrical issues, a seized motor, or a failure in the internal components. If the compressor is making unusual noises, not running, or excessively hot, it will need professional repair or replacement. This is a critical component that involves a complex repair. It is recommended to call a qualified technician to address any compressor problems. \n\nAs you've seen a Frigidaire freezer that's running but not freezing may be the result of various issues in the appliance. From worn-down door gaskets to faulty control boards, understanding the root causes is essential for effective troubleshooting. Regular maintenance, including cleaning  the coils, checking the seals, and monitoring temperature settings, is an important part of preventing future issues. By staying proactive in maintaining your Frigidaire freezer, you can extend the lifespan of your freezer and enjoy consistent and reliable freezing capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

But what happens if that technology starts acting up? If you see the error code 41, 42, or 41C on your Samsung Family Hub, there’s no need to panic. If you know how to restart your cellphone, you can resolve this error code! We’ll walk you through the steps below so you can get back to checking the news while grabbing the milk in no time.\n\nHow to Clear a 41/42 Error Code on a Samsung Fridge\n\nDepending on your model of Samsung fridge, you may be seeing either error code 41 or 42 with the blue lights inside the fridge flashing. In either case, it simply means that the Family Hub needs to be rebooted. To clear this error code, turn the system off using the power switch found on the inside top right of the door. After a few moments have passed, turn the Family Hub back on. This will reboot the system and error code 41 or 42 should now be cleared from the display.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n \n\nWhat is a 41C Error Code on a Samsung Fridge?\n\nError code 41C is specific to the French door style models of Samsung fridge, but also relates to an issue with the Family Hub. In this situation, a 41C error code means that the Family Hub requires a software update.\n\nHow to Update the Family Hub:\n\nBegin by swiping down from the top of the Family Hub screen, then select “Settings”\n\nSwipe through the settings until you find the “About Family Hub” option\n\nFrom there, tap “Software Update” and then tap “Update” to install\n\nOnce the update has been installed, the 41C error code should be cleared from your Samsung fridge.\n\nCommon Causes of a Samsung Fridge 41/42 Error Code\n\nLike any smart device, your Samsung fridge needs to be connected to a network, and the software and operating system need to be kept up to date to run optimally. The following are some common reasons why your Family Hub may display a 41, 42, or 41C error code in the future.\n\nPower Surge\n\nIf you’ve recently experienced a power outage, the Family Hub may not have restarted properly once the power was restored. Rebooting the system should resolve the problem. To protect your fridge from future power outages, we recommend that it is plugged into a surge protector.\n\nWeak Wi-Fi Connection\n\nYour smart fridge will need to be connected to your home’s wi-fi network to access all its tools and features. If the connection is weak, it could drop out causing the Family Hub to be offline. If this is a persistent issue, you may want to consider wi-fi extenders to ensure a strong connection in your kitchen.\n\nUpdates Needed\n\nSimilar to a smart phone or tablet, both the operating system and the individual apps with the Family Hub will need periodic updates. To check if an overall software update is needed, swipe through the settings to “About Family Hub” and then tap “Software Update.” If an update is available, you’ll be able to install it from here. To ensure your apps are kept up to date, turn on the “Automatic Update” option found under the Apps Setting.\n\nResolving this error code is generally as simple as the classic “turning it off and back on again.” However, if rebooting doesn’t resolve the issue, your Samsung fridge will need to be serviced by a technician. A downside to more advanced appliance technology is that it can mean a more advanced repair. If there is any doubt, calling a qualified appliance repair tech can help.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This means you only have two options for the shelves' continued use; repair or replace. Depending on the severity and level of damage to the shelf, you may be able to easily repair it with some household items like super–glue, an empty plastic container, and a clamp. But if your fridge shelf or drawer is damaged beyond repair, we are here to walk you through the steps for this easy repair!\n\nShould You Repair or Replace Refrigerator Shelves?\nRefrigerator shelves can be made out of many materials, and come in many different types and styles; plastic, acrylic, wire, wooden, metal, glass, etc. Some of those materials are much easier to fix and repair than others, and some, like glass, need to replaced outright simply due to their material being completely unusable once it's broken or cracked.\n\nA cracked or chipped refrigerator drawer can become difficult to not only move on its slide, but it can become borderline unusable if the damage done to it or its glide is in a specific location. Most times, it's significantly easier to simply replace a drawer or its glide, but you can easily mend or repair a cracked refrigerator drawer with a few household items.\n\nUltimately deciding whether repairing or replacing is worth it is up to you, the user. However, it's worth noting that a refrigerator shelf or drawer repair is in many occasions a temporary solution, and unfortunately not a permanent fix. But you can achieve a strong and durable refrigerator shelf using the tools and guide we have laid out below.\n\nHow to Fix a Refrigerator Shelf or Drawer\nBut if your fridge's shelf or drawer only has some minor damage, it can still be usable with some glue, parts from around the house, and a bit of DIY repair! Here is everything you'll need to get it done!\n\nSupplies Needed\n\n\n\nGlue or other adhesive rated for use with plastic and glass.\nProper safety equipment such as protective gloves.\nProper work surface.\nDisposable t-shirt, cardboard, or paper.\n(Optional) Spare metal [i.e. staple, wire, etc.].\n(Optional) Disposable plastic container [i.e. yogurt, milk, juice, etc.].\n(Optional) 200+ grit sandpaper.\n\n\n\nFix Cracked or Chipped Glass and Plastic Shelves with Glue\n\n\nIf possible, remove the glass/plastic shelf from the fridge interior and set on a flat surface.\nIdentify the affected area, and which parts of the glass or plastic are salvageable.\nCollect the pieces of glass or plastic and attempt to reconstruct the affected area.\nUsing your glue of choice, attach the glass or plastic pieces, and use a clamp (or your hands) to hold together for 15-30 minutes while it cures. Depending on the complexity of the damage, it may require longer to cure.\nOnce the glue has cured and is rigid, reassemble the shelf or drawer.\n\n\n\nFix Holes or Cracks in Refrigerator Shelves with Glue, Epoxy, and Spare Plastic\n\n\nIdentify which part(s) of the shelf/drawer are broken, and how large the damage is.\nFind a disposable carton or spare piece of plastic that will adequately cover the damaged area and cut it to size. Depending on what items you have in your home and what type of repair you're attempting, you can also use spare pieces of metal, such as staples or wire.\nIf the shelf, drawer, or glide is missing a section of part that is integral to its structure, the entire part will have to be replaced. However, if it simply needs a gap or hole filled, it can be fixed.\nRemove the shelf, drawer, or glide from the refrigerator itself.\nLay the shelf or drawer on a spare t-shirt or surface that can be tarnished.\nCarefully and generously spread your glue of choice onto the cracked or damaged area, and reattach any chunks that were missing.\nUsing a clamp or other similar device, allow the glue to cure for 30 minutes or up to an hour, depending on how large/complex the crack is.\nFlip the shelf/drawer over and apply glue to the underside of the affected area.\nThen, using your spare plastic container piece, staple(s), or wire, firmly apply it/them to the area until they're rigid. This will give the shelf back its structural integrity. If fixing a drawer glide, you may need to use a combination of metal and plastic pieces to achieve the best structural integrity.\n(Optional) Once the glue has dried and cured, use a fine (200+ grit) sandpaper to soften any residue from the glue.\nNow you can test the shelf/drawer/glide, and reassemble it into your refrigerator!\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Refrigerator Shelf\nReplacing a refrigerator shelf is not always as simple as just removing it and inserting the new one. With some refrigerator makes, models, and types, there may be screws that need to be unthreaded, or clips and clamps that need to be pushed in to ultimately be able to remove the shelf in question. And if you're worried about finding the right shelf, drawer and glides,  or rack for your refrigerator – there's no need! All of the parts you need for your fridge can be found at PartSelect.com!\n\n\n\nIdentify the shelf that needs to be replaced. This shelf may be made of plastic, glass, metal, etc.\nLocate any securing fasteners for the shelf and carefully remove them. These fasteners may be clamps that need to be untwisted, screws which would need a screwdriver to unthread, or a groove that you simply slide out of.\nIf you're removing a drawer, such as a crisper, remove the drawer first, then the glides (if both need replacing).\nIf the shelf you're replacing is made entirely of glass, be sure to inspect the shelf structure carefully. Some fridge models require you to remove the entire housing, whereas other glass shelves can be lifted and removed easily.\nCarefully lift or remove the shelf out of its slot.\nOnce the old shelf is removed, insert the new shelf carefully as well, as to not damage it or the fridge's interior.\nIf necessary, secure the new shelf within its housing and/or with the appropriate mechanism.\n\n\n\nTips For Replacing Different Refrigerator Shelf Types\n\nReplacing a Glass Refrigerator Shelf Insert\n\nWhen replacing a glass shelf insert within your fridge, handle it with care to avoid cracking or shattering it. Most refrigerator models with glass shelf panes will be made of tempered glass, so when removing it, whether to insert a new one or to clean it, allow it to return to room temperature before spraying it with water or cleaning spray. Otherwise, it will likely shatter and could potentially harm you and anyone around. You can replace a tempered glass shelf with an acrylic or strong plastic material, however, a material such as Corian is much more suitable as it's hypo-allergenic, easier to clean, and does not shatter.\n\nBe sure not to overload the glass itself, as tempered glass can normally only sustain around 35 lbs of force per square foot. To replace a glass pane shelf insert, simply lift it out of its position and pull it out. If your refrigerator's shelf frame has retaining clips, be sure to remove the frame as well, and undo the clips for the old glass pane before installing the new one. Then lay the new shelf where the old one was, and you're good to go!\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nReplacing a Glass Shelf with a Metal Frame\n\nReplacing a glass refrigerator shelf with a metal frame likely means that the glass or the frame is broken or cracked, and not able to support any food items on top or in a drawer below. In this case, it's almost impossible to repair, so replacing the shelf outright is normally the only option. It's important to remember that when removing a shelf with a glass pane to clean that you allow the shelf to warm to room temperature before spraying it with water or cleaner.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nReplacing a Metal or Plastic Refrigerator Door Shelf\n\nThe replacement process for a refrigerator door shelf is quite simple but does require instruction, depending on the type of securing mechanism. Some door shelves lift up and out, whereas some need to be pulled out directly from the door, and others have a clip or clamp securing them into the door. In any case, when replacing these shelves, it's important to install them carefully to avoid accidentally chipping, cracking, or bending the plastic or metal of the shelf itself.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Maintain a Refrigerator Shelf\nNo one wants an appliance that doesn't work as well as it could! Hopefully if you are reading this and you've reached the end of our guide, you have a fully functioning refrigerator shelf or drawer. If you repaired your shelf and it still failed to hold the items it needs to, then you've most likely replaced it! It's important to remember that cleaning your refrigerator shelves regularly and not overloading them with food items will allow you to keep using them for longer!\n\nFor all other home improvement and appliance-specific repair guides, check out our blogs, and for any and all parts you may need, stay tuned to PartSelect.com!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

An LoC code on a Maytag or Whirlpool appliance indicates an activation of the control lock, also known as a child lock. This is done as a preventative safety measure so children do not inadvertently activate the appliance. Since Whirlpool owns Maytag, many of their appliances, like washers, dryers, microwaves, ranges, and dishwashers share error codes and parts. The LoC code is interesting in that it is also shared by some other unrelated brands, including GE, Samsung, Amana, and Frigidaire. Depending on your Maytag or Whirlpool appliance and its model, you may also see a key or lock symbol on the display, in addition to the LoC code. We're going to cover how to clear this code and turn the control lock off, and which parts to inspect if you can't easily clear the LoC code.\n\nHow to Turn On and Turn Off Control Lock on Maytag and Whirlpool Appliances\nA control lock, also known as a child lock, is a safety feature included on many different appliances that, when engaged, stops the appliance from responding to inputs on the touchpad, so children do not accidentally activate the appliance. On Maytag and Whirlpool appliances, such as washers, dryers, dishwashers, ranges, and microwaves, there are two ways to turn it on and off; with a Control Lock button, or a specific button combination.\n\nActivate and Deactivate with Control Lock Button\nIf your Whirlpool or Maytag appliance's control lock has been accidentally activated, or if you'd like to know how to turn it on in the first place, you first need to look for a button with a 'Control Lock' label on it, but don't panic if you don't see one. Engaging the control lock with this method is easy; simply hold the dedicated button for 3–5 seconds, and you will likely see a key or lock symbol, a small light underneath the button, or an 'Loc', 'LoC', or 'LC' message appear on the display. This is letting you know that the control lock has been activated. To disengage and turn off the control lock, hold the same button for 3–5 seconds until the symbol or message disappears.\n\nActivate and Deactivate with Button Combination\nIf your Whirlpool or Maytag appliance does not have a dedicated 'Control Lock' button, and you're trying to turn the control lock on or off, you will need to hold a specific button combination. The buttons in question will depend on which model of the appliance you own, however, you can find your model's combination in your user Maytag or Whirlpool manual. An example of this is a support article for Maytag front-load washers, \"It could be a dual function key paired with another button like Extra Rinse, Steam, etc.\"\n\nHow to Reset Maytag and Whirlpool Appliances to Clear LoC Code\nIf your Maytag or Whirlpool appliance has an 'LoC', 'Loc', or 'LC' code that simply will not clear or turn off, no matter how many times you attempt to, a reset is a great place to start. Resetting an appliance, whether it's a dishwasher, washer, dryer, microwave, or range is simple and may only require a few minutes to do. There are two methods you can use to achieve this; a power reset, or control board reset.\n\nPower Reset\nThis is a universal method of resetting any appliance, no matter the occasion. Resetting an appliance with a power reset involves simply turning off power to it. Whether this is done by pulling out its power cord, or turning off the breaker supplying power, they're identical in their results. Leave the appliance disconnected for up to 5 minutes before reconnecting it. A power reset will completely restart the appliance, so it's normal for the appliance to make noise(s), since it's likely starting up to be usable.\n\nReset Button\nMany models of appliances include a 'Reset' button, which completely resets the control board, and effectively, the entire appliance. If for whatever reason, your appliance is unaffected and continues to not respond after a power reset, or if your appliance is difficult to move and/or its power source is difficult to access, a control board reset will normally do the trick.\n\nHow to Replace a Touchpad for Maytag and Whirlpool Appliances\nIf you've tried deactivating the control lock on your Maytag or Whirlpool appliance and/or tried resetting it, and it still won't respond to any of your inputs, it likely has a faulty touchpad. The touchpad can stop working for a multitude of reasons, however, defects, moisture damage, or ribbon cable tears are very common and will cause you to need to replace it. Note: Before beginning the repair for any appliance, disconnect it from its power source to avoid electrocution or discharging and damaging any circuit boards.\n\nReplace Whirlpool and Maytag Washer Touchpad\nMaytag and Whirlpool washers will display ‘LC’ or ‘Loc’ when their control lock is engaged, and if you’ve tried disengaging it and resetting it, a new touchpad is what it needs. The touchpad for a Maytag or Whirlpool washer can be fairly simple to replace and will only require a few tools, such as an OEM Maytag or Whirlpool touchpad panel, a Philips-head, flat-head and/or Torx-head screwdriver, and a set of pliers.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your washer from its wall outlet.\nUse a Philips-head screwdriver to unthread the screws in the rear of the washer holding the top panel. Once they're removed, pull it back and then lift it up to remove the top panel.\nPull out the dispenser drawer and depress the retaining clip to remove it completely.\nUse a Torx-head screwdriver (or whichever is necessary) to remove any screws on the dispenser drawer side of the panel.\nUnthread any securing screws holding the control panel touchpad inside the dryer cabinet.\nDepending on your model, you may also need to open the door of the washer to expose a screw underneath the control panel that needs to be unthreaded.\nPull the control panel away from the washer to pop it off, exposing its internal cables.\nDisconnect all securing cables and wire harnesses.\nRemove the touchpad assembly from the washer.\nIf there are any parts that are not included on the new panel, they will need to be removed and added to the new assembly before installation.\nOnce the new touchpad assembly is ready for installation, connect any necessary cables and wire harnesses.\nPush the control panel touchpad assembly into the washer until it clicks into place, being sure no cables or wires are being pinched.\nRe-thread any screws that were removed from the washer.\nReassemble the washer by replacing and securing the dispenser drawer and top panel.\nReconnect your washer to its wall outlet to turn it on.\nPress the different buttons on the touchpad to test the new panel.\n\n\n\nReplace Whirlpool and Maytag Dryer Touchpad\nIf you own a Whirlpool or Maytag dryer, it will display ‘Loc’ when the control lock is activated. If after an attempt to turn it off or reset your dryer, it still does not respond to any inputs, a new touchpad is in order. Removing and installing a new Maytag or Whirlpool dryer touchpad only requires a few tools, such as a Philips-head, Torx-head and/or flat-head screwdriver, a set of pliers, and an OEM Maytag or Whirlpool touchpad control panel.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dryer from its wall outlet.\nUse your Philips-head screwdriver to unthread and disconnect the top panel screws the back of the dryer.\nOnce those screws are unthreaded and removed, pull the top panel towards the back of the dryer and lift it up to remove it.\nRemove the dispenser drawer by pulling it out and depressing its securing clip.\nUnthread and remove the screws near the dispenser drawer.\nUnthread any screws securing the control panel.\nCarefully pull the control panel touchpad away from the dryer to remove it.\nDisconnect any cables or wires connected to the touchpad.\nRemove the touchpad from the dryer, and transfer any parts to the new touch that are only on the old one.\nInstall the new touchpad and secure it with the retaining screws and securing wire harnesses, ensuring it clicks into place properly and no wires are being crushed or pinched.\nReconnect the screws that were previously removed.\nReinstall the top panel of the dryer and its dispenser drawer.\nConnect your dryer to the wall outlet.\nTurn your dryer on and test it.\n\n\n\nReplace Whirlpool and Maytag Dishwasher Touchpad\nIf you own a dishwasher from Maytag or Whirlpool, you will see an indicator light or padlock that’s lit up when the control lock is turned on. If you try to turn it off, and even resetting the dishwasher itself can’t fix it, you’ll need to replace the touchpad. Replacing the touchpad of a Maytag or Whirlpool dishwasher is simple, and you only need a few tools to get it done, such as a Philips-head screwdriver or drill and drill bit, a set of pliers, and an OEM Maytag or Whirlpool dishwasher touchpad assembly.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet.\nOpen the dishwasher door and unthread each of the screws around the perimeter of the door.\nClose the door and slide the outside shell of the door towards the floor.\nRemove the shell of the door to expose its innards.\nLocate the control panel touchpad, and disconnect any securing screws and wires.\nRemove the old touchpad control panel.\nTransfer any parts from the old touchpad to the new touchpad if necessary.\nInstall the new touchpad, with its wires and securing screws.\nWith the new touchpad installed, reinstall the shell of the dishwasher door by placing it back, and sliding up towards its original resting position.\nOpen the dishwasher door again, keeping the shell in place, and rethread the securing screws back into their original position.\nReconnect the dishwasher to power, and test the new touchpad.\n\n\n\nReplace Whirlpool and Maytag Microwave Touchpad\nMaytag and Whirlpool microwaves utilize the LoC, L, and a padlock to display a control lock. If you've tried turning off the control lock and resetting your microwave, a replacement touchpad is likely necessary. Replacing the touchpad of your microwave is super simple, and only requires a Philips-head screwdriver, a set of pliers, and an OEM Maytag or Whirlpool microwave touchpad.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your microwave from its wall outlet.\nUse your Philips-head screwdriver to unthread the screw securing the grille.\nLift the grille to remove it.\nUnthread and remove any screws securing the touchpad assembly.\nLift the touchpad assembly, and it should pull back and expose the inner wires.\nTake note of each cables position and connection point.\nDisconnect each wire, and then carefully pull the assembly out from the microwave. You may also need to remove a ground wire – do this with caution.\nDisconnect the ribbon cable(s) carefully, and unthread any screws. Then remove the touchpad's inner board.\nInsert that inner board into the new touchpad, and install it with the previously removed screws and ribbon cable.\nSecure the ground wire in the new touchpad assembly.\nReconnect the remaining wires to the inner board.\nPush the new touchpad into place.\nThread any necessary securing screws.\nReconnect the grille to the microwave.\nReconnect the microwave to power and test it.\n\n\n\nReplace Whirlpool and Maytag Range Touchpad\nWhirlpool and Maytag ranges utilize the 'Loc' or 'LoC' codes, as well as a lock symbol to display a control lock activation, and if you've already tried clearing it and resetting your range, your touchpad likely needs to be replaced. Replacing a range touchpad is easy and only requires a Philips-head screwdriver and an OEM Whirlpool or Maytag touchpad assembly!\n\n\n\nDisconnect your range from its wall outlet.\nUnthread and remove the securing screws on the back panel of your range.\nUnthread the mounting screws for the main control board.\nDisconnect the cables and wires connecting the touchpad to the main control board.\nUse your screwdriver and unthread the touchpad housing from the range.\nDetach the touchpad from its housing and replace it with the new touchpad.\nConnect the touchpad housing to your range.\nConnect all necessary wires and cables between the main control board and the touchpad.\nSecure both the main control board and touchpad within your range.\nReconnect the back panel of your range.\nConnect your range to power and test the touchpad.\n\n\n\nMaintaining a Maytag or Whirlpool Appliance\nIf you've made it to this point, hopefully you now have a working touchpad in your Maytag or Whirlpool appliance!

The Ub code may sometimes be misread as U6, however, it refers to the same issue. The most common causes for these error codes include clothes tangling together during the wash cycle, overloading the washer beyond its capacity, and the washer not being level with the floor. Additionally, if you are seeing the Ub (U6) or Ur codes, you will need to inspect the mechanical components of the washer which are responsible for keeping the washer steady during use such as the shock absorbers, levelling legs, suspension springs and dampening straps. \n\nWhat Does the Ub (U6)  and Ur Code Mean on Samsung Washers?\nThe Ub (U6), and Ur codes mean that your Samsung washer is unbalanced. The Ub code is telling you that the washer itself isn't balanced properly, while the Ur code is telling you that the clothes inside aren't evenly distributed, making the drum unsteady. These codes usually show up during or just before the spin cycle. It's also easy to confuse 'Ub' with 'U6' since they look alike on the washer's display, but they are the same code. To prevent damage, the washer will automatically stop when these codes appear.\n\nWhat Causes the Ub and Ur Codes on Samsung Washers?\n\nTangled Clothes: When clothes tangle, they can create a heavy spot in the drum. This often happens with items that have strings or tassels if they're not placed in netted bags.\nOverloading the Washer: If you fill the drum beyond three-quarters of its capacity, it can prevent clothes from moving freely, leading to uneven distribution and imbalance. It's better to wash bulky items separately rather than overloading the machine.\nWasher Not Being Level: If your washer isn't level with the floor, it can cause imbalance issues.\nWear and Tear: Over time, mechanical parts like shock absorbers and dampening straps can wear out. When these parts are worn, they can no longer effectively stabilize the drum during the spin cycle.\nSystem Glitches: Occasionally, the Ub (U6) error code may be triggered by a system glitch, even when there's no actual imbalance.\n\n\nHow to Clear the Ub (U6) or Ur Codes on Samsung Washers\nTo resolve the Ub (U6) or Ur codes on your Samsung washer, start by redistributing your laundry, attempting a reset next, then checking if the washer is level, and if all else fails, taking a closer look at its internal parts.\n\nHow to Balance the Load in a Samsung Washer\nTo address the Ub (U6) or Ur error code on your washer, make sure that the laundry is neither unevenly distributed nor overloading the drum.\n\nRedistribute Clothing Evenly: First, open the washer and rearrange the clothing. Make sure that heavier items such as towels, sheets, coats, and jeans are not concentrated on one side. Untangle any sheets and evenly distribute cotton items, bearing in mind that different materials absorb water differently and can become heavier when wet.\nRemove Excess Items: If the drum appears overloaded, it's important to lessen the load. This is particularly crucial with bulky items like comforters, jackets, or jeans. Remove some items and then run a test cycle to see if the error code has been resolved.\n\n\nHow to Reset a Samsung Washer\nThe control board on your Samsung washer controls the functions of the washer by sending and receiving signals to and from other parts of the washer. If it experiences a minor glitch, it may be unable to communicate with the washer properly resulting in the appearance of the Ub or Ur error codes. Resetting your washer is an effective way to clear these codes. This process can often erase error codes by refreshing the washer's internal memory and resolving temporary software glitches. Power cycling your Samsung washer means turning it off and on again to reset its system. Here's how to do it:\n\nDisconnect the washing machine from its power source. You can do this either by unplugging it from the wall socket or by switching off the dedicated circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel.\nLeave the washing machine unplugged for up to 5 minutes.\nReconnect the washer to its power supply and operate it as you normally would, checking to see if the error codes have been successfully cleared.\n\n\nHow to Check the Level on a Samsung Washer\nIf power cycling does not work, you need to check and adjust the level of your washer's legs so it sits perfectly horizontal on the floor. If the levelling legs are broken, you need to replace them. \n\nPlace a level tool on top of your washer. If it shows that the washer is not level, you need to adjust legs.\nTo make adjustments, locate the locking nut on each leg and use a wrench to loosen it. Turn the leg clockwise to lower it or counterclockwise to raise it. Continue adjusting all the legs until the washer is level.\nMake sure all four leveling legs are firmly in contact with the floor. If you have slippery floors, consider placing non-skid pads under the legs for added stability.\nFinally, tighten the locking nuts against the washer base using a wrench to secure them in place and enhance stability.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot and Replace the Levelling Legs on a Samsung Washer \nIt's common for the levelling legs on your washer to wear down over time or become damaged. This is especially true if the washer was not installed correctly or is constantly moving around. Faulty levelling legs will make the washer unsteady and result in shaking and moving during use. This movement may affect the balance of the laundry load and result in the Ub or Ur error code.\n\nDisconnect the washer from the outlet or turn it off at the circuit breaker.\nTilt the washer backwards to access the levelling legs.\nUnscrew the levelling legs using a set of pliers and remove them from the washer.\nPlace the new legs over the mounting holes and manually thread them in using your hands. Be careful not to over tighten the legs as this can damage them and the washer.\nTilt the washer back forward back onto the floor.\nYou can take your level too once again and check that the washer is now level.\nReconnect your washer to the power source and run a short cycle to ensure the error code is resolved.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot and Replace the Shock Absorbers on a Samsung Washer\nShock absorbers prevent excessive shaking and bouncing during your washer's spin cycle. As their name suggests, these components absorb the shocks generated while washing, stabilizing the machine. They are typically located inside the washer, nestled between the outer tub and the base frame. If the shock absorbers are faulty, your washer may become unsteady and shake excessively during use, resulting in the Ub (U6) or Ur error code. \n\nIf you notice unusual banging or thumping noises coming from your washer, observe a sagging or drooping tub, or spot visible cracks or fluid leakage from the shock absorbers, it's time to replace them.\n\n\nUnplug the washer or turn off the circuit breaker.\nRemove the top panel by unscrewing the back screws and lifting it off.\nRemove the front components such as the dispenser drawer and hose. Unscrew and set aside the housing and control panel.\nAccess the shock absorbers by opening the door, removing the seal, lock, and front panel screws.\nUnscrew the old shock absorbers and replace them with new ones.\nReattach the front panel, seal, and door. Reconnect electrical connections and control panel. Put the top panel back and screw it in.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot and Replace the Suspension Springs on a Samsung Washer\nSuspension springs are designed to control and minimize movement and vibrations in your washer, especially during heavy-load washing and spinning cycles. If the springs are no longer working properly, the washer will become unsteady and unbalanced, resulting in the Ub (U6) or Ur error code. You can usually find the suspension springs at the bottom of the washer frame, connected to each of the four corners of the appliance or the base frame.\nWhen checking your suspension springs, look out for signs that they need replacement. These signs include visible stretching, bending out of shape, corrosion, or detachment from their attachment points.\n\nStart by unplugging the washer and gathering the necessary tools: a Phillips screwdriver, flat blade screwdriver, lubricant, and rope puller.\nRemove the top panel by unscrewing its back screws and lifting it off.\nAccess the springs, one of which is visible and another located under the dispenser housing.\nDetach the hose and take out the dispenser drawer.\nWearing gloves for safety, unscrew and remove the rear access panel.\nUse the flat blade screwdriver to open the spring holder. Then, use the rope puller to remove the old spring and install the new one, ensuring you lubricate the hooks first.\nReattach the rear panel, detergent housing, hose, drawer, and top panel.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot and Replace the Dampening Straps on a Samsung Washer\nDampening straps in your machine keep the inner tub stable during washing. They are usually found at the top corners of the washer, connecting the tub to the cabinet frame. These straps, along with suspension rods, control the tub's movement and vibrations. If the inner tub is unstable, your washer may be unbalanced and unable to distribute the load in the drum evenly, resulting in the Ub or Ur error. You can tell that they need to be replaced if they appear frayed, stretched out, or have any visible cracks or tears.\n\nBegin by unplugging the washer.\nAccess the dampening straps by opening the washer cabinet and locating the four straps connected between the tub and cabinet corners.\nUnthread the screws at the back of the control panel and rotate it forward, disconnecting any necessary wires.\nRelease the spring clips using a putty knife and remove the front panel.\nUnthread the screws to lift off the main top.\nProceed to unthread the screws holding the old straps to the tub and frame, then remove the old straps.\nSecure one side of each new strap to the tub with a screw and attach the bracket from the old strap to the new one. Connect the bracket and strap to the frame. Repeat this step for all the straps.\nReassemble the washer by replacing the main top, snapping back the front panel, and reconnecting the control board and its wires.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot and Replace the Bearings on a Samsung Washer\nBearings are metal rings that support the rotation of the tub during the cycle. They are typically located beneath the outer tub towards the back of the machine and can be accessed by removing the back panel. If the bearings are worn down the tub will be unable to spin smoothly, or at all, which makes it difficult to distribute the washer load, and therefore resulting in the Ub (U6) or Ur error code. The bearings need to be replaced if they are rusted or damaged.\n\nUnplug the washer for safety. Gather these necessary tools: wrenches, screwdrivers, socket set, gear puller, rubber mallet, silicon sealant, lubricant, and replacement bearings.\nRemove the back panel with a screwdriver to access the bearings. For front-loading machines, also remove the top panel, control panel, and door gasket.\nDrain any water using the drain hose. Remove the front panel, gasket, tub weights, hoses, thermistor, heater wires, and rear panel. Disconnect and remove the drum.\nUse a gear puller to remove old bearings.

Depending on your model, if your Samsung washer is displaying an error code 5C, SC, 5E, or SE it means there is a drainage issue. The digital display may appear to be showing the letter “S” but the proper codes per Samsung are 5C or 5E. This drainage error code typically means there is a blockage with the drain pump filter, or an issue with the drain hose. We will show you how to resolve the 5C/5E error code, and how to prevent it from happening again in the future.\n\n\nHow to Drain Your Samsung Washer\n\nIf your washer still has water in the tub, it is possible to manually drain this from the machine. You will need a towel for the floor and container to catch the water in. After disconnecting the power to the washer, remove the filter cover from the bottom front panel of the machine and locate the drain tube. Position the end of the tube over your container before removing the stopper. Remove the stopper from the drain tube and allow the water to flow out. Once the water has completely drained from your Samsung washer, you should next inspect the drain pump filter and give it a clean to prevent future drainage issues. \n\n\nParts to Inspect to Clear a Samsung Washer 5C/5E Error Code\n\nDrain Pump Filter\nIf your Samsung washer is a front-load machine, it will have a drain pump filter which helps prevent lint and other debris from damaging the pump. Like all household filters, it needs to be regularly cleaned to work efficiently. A clogged filter can prevent your washer from draining properly, which may result in seeing an error code and a tub full of water.\nHow to Inspect the Drain Pump Filter\n\nBefore you begin, disconnect the power to your washer, and then remove the filter cover found at the bottom of the front panel.\n\nYou will want to place a towel down beneath the cover, along with a container to catch any water that might be left in the machine. Pull out the drain tube and remove the stopper to allow any water to drain from the machine into the container. Replace the stopper and place the tubing back into the housing.\n\nTo remove the filter, twist it counterclockwise and pull it out. Inspect the filter for any signs of damage. If the filter is not salvageable by cleaning it, it will need to be replaced with a new drain pump filter.\nIf the filter isn't damaged but just clogged, it can be cleaned by running it under the sink and using a soft bristle brush, like a toothbrush, to remove any debris.\n\nTo reinstall the filter, place it back into the slot and turn clockwise to lock it in place.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Drain Pump Filter on a Samsung Washer\n\nReplacing the drain pump filter is as simple as twisting out and discarding the old filter and inserting a new one in its place.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\nDrain Hose\n\nHow to Inspect the Drain Hose\n\nStart by visually inspecting the drain hose for any issues like kinks or cracks in the hose. A kinked or bent hose can be resolved by straightening it out, but if there are splits or cracks it will need to be replaced. If there are no visible issues with the hose, next check for any blockages by feeling along the length of the hose. You will likely be able to feel where debris is trapped and will need to be cleared out. Finally check to ensure that the hose isn’t submerged too far down the standpipe; about six inches of the drain hose should be inserted.\n\nProper Installation of a Samsung Washer Drain Hose\n\nIf the drain hose for your washer was not installed at the correct height (between 39 to 96 inches per Samsung), it can cause issues with drainage. If the drain hose is too high (above 96 inches), it reduces the draining capabilities and may leave you with water remaining in your machine. A drain hose installed too low (below 39 inches) can cause a siphoning effect, which causes the machine to fill and drain at the same time. If the height of the drain hose is in the proper range, next check that it isn’t inserted too far down the standpipe. There should be six inches of drain hose in the standpipe, more than that could also cause siphoning issues. The last item to check for proper drain hose installation is that the connection between the hose and the standpipe is not airtight.\n\nHow to Replace a Drain Hose on a Samsung Washer\n\nTo replace the drain hose, begin by disconnecting the power and turning off the water supply to the washer.\n\nAt the back of the machine, use a set of pliers to release the clamps holding the drain hose in place.\n\nIf the hose had a blockage and just needs to be cleaned, it can now be flushed with water or with a drain snake, then reconnected to the machine.\n\nIf the hose is damaged, discard the old hose and clamp a new drain hose in place on your washer.\n\n\nDrain Pump\n\nHow to Inspect the Drain Pump\n\nIf cleaning the drain pump filter and the drain hose did not solve the 5C/5E error code issue with your Samsung washer, you should next inspect the drain pump itself. Depending on your model, you may need to place the washer on its side or remove the back panel to access the drain pump. Visually inspect the pump for any signs of damage. If none are obvious, you can use a multimeter to test for continuity. If there is no reading, or the results are not within range, then the pump has failed and will need to be replaced with a new drain pump.  \n\nHow to Replace a Drain Pump on a Samsung Washer\n\nThe new drain pump can be installed by reversing the steps used to remove the damaged pump from your washer. Reconnect the hoses and wire harness, then the water and power supply can be turned back on.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \nPressure Switch\n\nHow to Inspect the Pressure Switch\n\nThe pressure switch is used to tell the washer’s control board when to add or remove water from the machine. If cleaning or replacing the above parts has still not corrected the 5C/5E error code, then the pressure switch may be to blame. Disconnect power to your washer, then locate the pressure switch (reference your user manual for the exact location in your Samsung washer). Remove the tubes and wire harness from the pressure switch, so that it can be tested with a multimeter. If the reading comes back out of range, or doesn’t produce a reading at all, the part has failed and will need to be replaced with a new pressure switch.  \n\nHow to Replace a Pressure Switch on a Samsung Washer\n\nConnect the new pressure switch to the wire harness and clip the switch back into place on the machine.\n\nThen connect the air pressure tubes to the switch.\n\nReassemble any panels that were removed to access the pressure switch.\n\nFinish up by reconnecting the water and power supply to the washer.\n \n\nIf you’ve tried all the above parts and you are still receiving a 5C/SC/5E/SE error code on your Samsung washer, it may be time to call in a professional repair technician for their diagnosis. Generally, this error code is a simple fix, and easily preventable with regular cleaning of your washer’s drain pump filter.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

It is important to address this issue promptly as the condensed water can mix with lint in the dryer and clog the vents further, which creates the perfect conditions for mold to grow uncontrollably. Use this guide to understand the common causes behind this frustrating problem and discover effective solutions to get rid of the excess moisture in your dryer. Say goodbye to damp laundry and hello to keeping your clothes and laundry space comfortably dry.\n\nImproperly Stored Dryer\nCondensation in a dryer can be influenced the environment where the dryer is stored. Here's how:\n\n\nMoisture Control: High humidity levels in the storage area can contribute to condensation inside the dryer. When the temperature eventually lowers or when the moist air makes contact with the cooler surfaces of the dryer, the result is increased condensation.\nPoor Ventilation:If the dryer is stored in an enclosed space where there is limited airflow and insufficient venting, it may lead to moisture build up.\nTemperature: Similar to the above point, storing the dryer in a cold environment can lead to condensation when the warm, moist air from drying meets the cold surfaces.\n\n\n\nHow to Store Your Dryer to Prevent Condensation\n\n\nEnsure that the storage space is well-ventilated. Adequate airflow helps prevent the accumulation of moisture.\nTry to store the dryer in a space with a relatively stable temperature. If the storage area is cold, it may be beneficial to insulate it or use a dehumidifier.\nUse moisture-absorbing materials (like desiccants or moisture-absorbing bags) in the storage space to help control humidity.\nIf possible, store the dryer in a space where it can be vented to the outside. Ensure that any venting is directed away from the dryer and to the exterior.\nStore it in such a way that you can easily access and clean the vent (exhaust) duct and vent hose to ensure proper airflow.\n\n\n\nClogged Lint Filter\nThe lint filter is designed to catch lint and debris from your clothes, in order to allow hot air to pass through. When the filter is clogged, it restricts the airflow, causing the hot, moist air to stay within the dryer for longer periods of time. This trapped moisture in the air will eventually condense within the dryer or vent system, leading to dampness and wetness inside your dryer.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Lint Filter\n\n\nEnsure the dryer is turned off and unplugged to ensure safety during the cleaning process.\nFind the lint filter, typically located inside the door rim or on top of the dryer.\nRemove any visible lint by hand. For a more thorough cleaning, use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner with a nozzle attachment to clear lint from the filter.\nCheck for any damage to the lint filter. If it has holes or tears, it's best to replace the lint filter.\nUse a vacuum cleaner or a brush to clean the area where the lint filter is inserted to remove any additional lint or debris.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Lint Filter\n\n\nEnsure the dryer is powered off and unplugged for safety.\nCarefully pull or slide out of the old filter from its designated compartment.\nInsert the new lint filter into the empty slot. Ensure it fits securely and sits flat.\nTo prevent future issues, clean the lint filter after every load or, at a minimum, before each drying cycle. Regular maintenance helps maintain optimal dryer performance and prevents condensation problems.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Clean a Clogged Vent Tube\n\n\nTurn off the dryer and unplug it from the electrical outlet.\nMove the dryer away from the wall to access the vent tube, and detach the tube from the back of the dryer.\nCarefully inspect the vent tube for any lint, debris, or blockages. You can use a vacuum cleaner or a vent cleaning brush to remove any buildup. \nGo outside to where the vent tube exits your home. Check the external vent for any obstructions, such as lint, bird nests, or debris. Clear away anything that might be prevent air from escaping.\nExamine the vent cap on the exterior of your home and ensure it opens and closes properly.\nReattach the vent tube to the back of the dryer securely and position it such that that there are no kinks or sharp bends in the tube.\nMake it a routine to clean the vent tube and inspect the external vent at least once a year to prevent lint buildup and ensure proper airflow.\n\n\n\nIncorrectly Positioned Vent Tube\nIf there are sharp bends or kinks in vent tube, air cannot freely flow out of the dryer and instead the moist air accumulates in the dryer and then condenses into water droplets. The condensation of moisture within the dryer can lead to damp clothes, longer drying times, and potential damage to the appliance. If you are in need of a new vent tube use our model search feature to find the right one for your dryer. \n\nHow to Position the Vent Tube Correctly\n\n\nTurn off the dryer and disconnect it from the power outlet. \nCheck the current position of the vent tube. It should be as straight as possible, with minimal bends and turns.\nEnsure the vent tube is made of rigid metal or flexible aluminum. It is recommended to avoid using plastic, as it can sag and accumulate lint more easily.\nKeep the vent tube as short as possible to maximize airflow efficiency, as longer tubes can result in increased resistance to airflow and moisture retention.\nSupport the vent tube with straps or brackets to prevent it from sagging, which can hinder airflow.\nEnsure the vent tube directs the expelled air outside and not into an attic or crawl space. Venting into enclosed spaces can lead to condensation and moisture-related problems.\n\n\n\nInstall a Vent Flap or Booster Fan\nA vent flap acts as a protective barrier against external elements while allowing the removal of hot air, moisture, and lint from the dryer. It is designed to open when the dryer is running, allowing the air and moisture to exit the duct. When the dryer is not in use, the flap closes to prevent cold air, pests, or debris from entering the vent system. It is typically typically installed at the end of the vent duct.\nA booster fan helps to increase the airflow through the vent system, to ensure that the moist air moist air is pushed out effectively. Booster fans are especially beneficial in situations where the dryer is located far from an external wall or when the venting system has multiple bends and turns, which can restrict airflow. It is typically installed inline with the ductwork.\nDiscover effective solutions to eliminate condensation in your dryer. Get rid of excess moisture in a few simple methods and learn how to prevent future issues.\n\nThese simple components can help you to maintain the efficiency of the vent system, preventing blockages and ensuring efficient ventilation. Choose a type that suits your dryer and venting system.\n\nHow to Install a Vent Flap or Booster\n\n\nTurn off the dryer and unplug it from the power source. If you have a gas dryer, turn off the gas supply.\nIdentify the location in the vent line where you plan to install the vent flap or booster. This is typically in a straight section of the duct.\nEach vent flap or booster may have specific installation instructions provided by the manufacturer. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure proper installation.\nIf the booster requires you to cut the vent duct, use a proper cutting tool to create an opening according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\nAttach the vent flap or booster and secure with the appropriate hardware, which may be clamps, screws, or other fasteners.\nEnsure that all joints and connections are sealed tightly to prevent air leaks. \nOnce the vent flap or booster is installed, reconnect the vent duct to the back of the dryer and secure it in place.\nTurn on the dryer and check that the vent flap or booster is functioning correctly by checking for a steady and strong flow of air.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and addressing the causes of condensation in your dryer is essential for maintaining the efficiency of your appliance. Remember, a dryer free from condensation preserves the lifespan of your appliance, prevents the growth of mold, and also guarantees that your clothes emerge dry, fresh, and ready to wear. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Faulty Rotor Mounting NutHow to Replace the Rotor Mounting Nut to Fix the LG Washer UE ErrorThe LG washer uE/UE error code indicates that the washer load is unbalanced. The uE code, with a lower case 'u', specifically means that the washer is still attempting to resolve the issue on its own. You may hear the washer attempting to drain and spin - allow this process to continue. The UE code, with an upper case 'U', is a sign that the washer has failed to balance the load and will require assistance. On some washer models, this code may be displayed as the Ub error code, however, it indicates the same unbalanced load issue. An unbalanced load can occur when the load in the drum is not distributed evenly, when the washer drum is overloaded, or when the washer is not level. An unbalanced load can lead to excessive vibration and shaking during the spin cycle, potentially causing damage to the washer or surrounding areas. Therefore, it is important to address this issue promptly and restore your washer to full functionality.\n\nReset Your LG Washer to Clear the UE Error\nSoft Reset\n\n\nPress the \"Power\" or \"Cancel\" button to turn off your washer.\nSafely unplug the washing machine from the power outlet.\nLeave the washer unplugged for about 5 minutes.\nReconnect the washing machine to the power outlet.\nPress the \"Power\" or \"Start\" button to turn your washer back on.\n\n\n\nHard Reset\n\n\nTurn off your washer and disconnect it from the power outlet.\nTurn off the circuit breaker that is connected to your washer.\nWait for approximately 5-10 minutes.\nSwitch the breaker back to the \"On\" position. \nReconnect the washer to the power outlet and turn it back on. \n\n\n\nRun a Rinse and Spin Cycle\n\n\nRemove all items from the washer drum.\nTurn the washer on.\nSelect the \"Rinse and Spin\" cycle on your washer.\nPress the \"Start\" button and allow the cycle to run to completion.\n\n\n\nTop 6 Causes and Solutions for the LG Washer UE Error\n\n1. Unbalanced Washer Load\nIf you washer drum is overloaded or the load is unevenly distributed, the drum may become unbalanced during the spin cycle resulting in the UE error. This is especially true if the error code is displayed at the beginning of the cycle. It is important to follow the loading instructions and weight capacity limit provided for your LG washing machine to ensure it remains in optimal condition. \n\nHow to Rebalance Your LG Washer: \n\n\nPause the cycle, open the washer door, and manually move the laundry around inside the drum. \nIf drum is too full, take out some items to reduce the weight and create a more balanced load.\nMake sure you are using the appropriate washing machine cycle for the type and amount of laundry you are washing. Different cycles have different spin speeds, and selecting the right one can help prevent imbalance issues.\nAvoid washing several bulky items at once or if you do, try adding a few smaller items to balance the load.\n\n\n\n2. Faulty Levelling Legs\nThe levelling legs are adjustable feet located underneath the washer that ensure that the washer is level with the surface. They may wear down over time or become damaged if the washer is moved around a lot or not installed correctly. Faulty levelling legs can cause the washer to become unsteady and unbalanced during the spin cycle, resulting in the UE error. You may also notice that your washer shakes and jerks around, or is particularly noisy during use. \nThis issue may be resolved by lowering or raising the legs, which you can do using a pliers or a wrench. However, if an adjustment does not resolve the error, you will need to replace the levelling legs. \n\nHow to Replace the Levelling Legs to Fix LG Washer UE Error\n\n\nDisconnect the washer from the power source.\nPull the washer away from the wall and lean it backward to access the levelling legs on the washer's underside. \nInspect the legs for signs of wear and if there is visible damage, you will need to replace the damaged legs.\nUse a pair of channel lock pliers to unthread the levelling legs. \nPosition the new legs on the mounting surface. \nUse a pair of channel lock pliers or your hands to screw in the leg until it is firmly in place.\nCarefully lower the washer back onto the floor and check that it is steady and unmoving.\nYou can also use a bubble level to ensure that your washer is in fact level and flat.\nReconnect your washer to the power outlet check and run a short cycle to ensure the UE error is resolved.\n\n\n\n3. Faulty Shock Absorbers\nThe shock absorbers in your washer help reduce excessive vibrations during the spin cycle. If a shock absorber is damaged or worn out, it will be unable to absorb the vibrations, leading to excessive movement of the drum. This movement makes it difficult for the washer to distribute the load evenly, leading to an unbalanced load. You will need to replace the shock absorbers to resolve the UE error. \n\nHow to replace Shock Absorbers to Fix the LG Washer UE Error\n\n\nUnplug the washer from the electrical outlet to ensure safety.\nRemove the front panel of your washer to access the shock absorbers.\nYou can find the shock absorbers connected to the tub and the cabinet at the bottom of the washer.\nInspect the shock absorbers for signs of damage, such as leaks, cracks, or excessive wear and replace any that are damaged.\nUse a screwdriver or pliers to remove the mounting hardware that secures the shock absorbers and remove them from the washer. \nAttach the replacement shock absorbers to the mounting points on the tub and cabinet and secure them in place.\nReassemble the washer and plug it back into the electrical outlet.\n\n\n\n4. Faulty Suspension Rods\nSimilar to shock absorbers, suspension rods play a crucial role in stabilizing the drum. They support the weight of the drum and help prevent excessive movement during the spin cycle. If a suspension rod is broken or damaged, it can result in uneven distribution of the load, leading to the UE error. Use our model search to find replacement suspension rods for your washer.\n\nHow to Replace the Suspension Rods\n\n\nRemove the back panel of the washer, then lift the entire main top and secure it upright.\nLocate the suspension rods in each corner of the washer, with a spring attached to the tub. \nTake hold of the rod and and rotate the ball to disconnect it, before dropping the rod back through the opening.\nCompress the suspensions springs to release the tension and carefully remove them. \nSlide the new suspension rods through the opening and ensure each rod is oriented correctly.\nCompress the springs again and hook the top of the rods to prevent the rods from falling down later.\nInstall the four new cups into each corner, then snap the new suspension balls onto the suspension rods.\nBe sure to attach any tub centering springs back onto the rods before pulling them up through the cups.\nRepeat the process for all four corners and rods.\n\n\n\n5. Faulty Hall Sensor \nThe hall sensor, also known as a rotor position sensor, detects the speed and operation of the washer. It provides feedback to the washer's control board, allowing it to adjust as needed for proper spinning and balancing of the load. If the hall sensor malfunctions or fails, it can lead to an unbalanced load condition, triggering the UE error. Use our model search feature to find a new hall sensor\n\nHow to Access the Hall Sensor to Fix LG Washer UE Error\n\n\nUnplug the washer from the electrical outlet, and turn off the water supply to the washer. \nRemove the back panel to access the hall sensor, which is typically mounted on or near the motor.\nInspect the sensor and wiring for any visible damage or loose connections. If there is no damage, you can test the sensor with a multimeter to check for electrical failure.\n\n\n\nHow to Test the Hall Sensor with a Multimeter\n\n\nCarefully disconnect the wires connected to the hall sensor.\nSet your multimeter to the resistance (ohms) setting.\nPlace the multimeter probes on the hall sensor terminals and check the reading. Refer to your washer's manual to check if the reading is within the correct range.\nIf the hall sensor fails the resistance test or if there are visible issues, it will need to be replaced.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Hall Sensor to Fix the LG Washer UE Error\n\n\nRemove the screws or clips that secure the hall sensor in place. \nGently pull the hall sensor to remove it from its mounting position.\nPosition the new hall sensor in the same location. \nSecure it in place with the mounting screws or clips.\nReconnect the wires to the new hall sensor, ensuring that they are properly seated and secure.\nReassemble the washer in the reverse order of disassembly.\nPlug the washer back in and run a test cycle to ensure that the hall sensor replacement has resolved the issue.\n\n\n\n6. Faulty Rotor Mounting Nut\nThe rotor mounting nut secures the rotor to the motor shaft. If the rotor mounting nut is loose, corroded or damaged, it can affect the balance of the drum. A loose or compromised rotor mounting nut can cause the drum to wobble during the spin cycle, contributing to an unbalanced load and triggering the UE error. If retightening the nut does not balance washer, then you will likely need to replace the rotor mounting nut.\n\nHow to Replace the Rotor Mounting Nut to Fix the LG Washer UE Error\n\n\nUnplug the washer from the electrical outlet, and turn off the water supply to the washer.\nDepending on your washer model you may either need to remove the front and top panels, or tip the washer over to access the rotor assembly. \nLocate the rotor assembly and inspect the mounting nut for signs of damage or loose connection. \nIf it is loose retighten it. Otherwise, use an adjustable wrench and hit it with a hammer to help remove it from the mounting position.\nPosition the new mounting nut in its position and torque the nut according to the specifications in your user manual.\nReassemble your washer in reverse order.\nPlug the washer back in, turn on the water supply, and run a test cycle to ensure everything is working correctly.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the factors that contribute to unbalanced loads, such as unevenly distributed laundry or overloading, is key to resolving the LG washer UE error and ensuring a hassle-free laundry experience. By following practical steps like redistributing the laundry, removing excess items, and ensuring the machine is level you can DIY you washer back to life! It is important to perform regular maintenance on your washer and replace faulty parts promptly. Taking the time to do so will allow you to easily resolve any errors that occur, and maintain the performance and longevity of your LG washer for years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

All you need are a few tools, such as a screwdriver and wrench, and some supplies, like a flexible gas line, dryer exhaust hose, and a soap-water solution. Come with us and learn how to easily install a gas dryer today, and get warm, dry clothes as soon as possible!\n\nWhat Do You Need to Install a Gas Dryer?\n\nInstalling a gas dryer is a little more complicated than installing an electric dryer, but that doesn't mean it isn't still doable. If you have the right supplies, and some DIY spirit, anything is possible!\n\nSupples you will need:\n\n\n\nAvailable wall outlet.\nGas line to dryer installation location.\nScrewdriver(s) with Philips-head and flat-head tips.\nSoap-water solution (1 tea-spoon of soap in 3 cups of water).\nDryer exhaust hose.\nFlexible gas line.\nPipe joint compound, also known as 'pipe dope' OR teflon tape.\nStraight or elbow exhaust vents.\nScrew-style clamp.\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Gas Dryers\n\nIf you've never installed a gas dryer before, let alone an electric dryer, you may have some questions that need answered; here are some answers to popular questions other DIYers have, that you may too:\n\n\n\nCan you install a gas dryer yourself? Installing a gas dryer is absolutely something you can do on your own. However, it's much easier done with two people versus just one. But if you're not feeling confident to maneuver a dryer around your home on your own, and you don't have someone to assist you, or if you're not comfortable working with gas, have a professional handle the installation.\nDo you need a 110 V line for a gas dryer? Yes, gas dryers normally only take the common 110 V outlet, and come with a two-pronged power cord. Whereas electric dryers use three and four-pronged cords and a 240 V line.\nDo gas dryers need special venting? Gas dryers don't need any more specialized venting than a normal electric dryer would. The only venting you'd need is for the dryer's exhaust, to expel the lint and excess hot air to the outside.\nCan you use a gas dryer without gas? A gas dryer can be used without a gas line hooked up, however, you can expect to use a lot of electricity and wait a long time for even somewhat dry clothes. Without the gas for the heating element, the dryer will not be drying the clothes inside.\nCan you install a gas dryer with propane? Yes, gas dryers running on propane is a common occurrence, and can be done relatively easily; all you need is the proper natural gas to liquid propane conversion kit!\n\n\n\nHow to Install a Gas Dryer\nNow that you're ready to install your new gas dryer, ensure you're practicing the utmost safety and staying observant. If you begin to smell anything that may smell like gas, make sure to shut off your gas line and stop handling anything that could cause a spark.\n\n\n\nEnsure you have a gas line with a valve shutoff, and proper venting setup at your installation location, as well as ample space for the dryer itself.\nTurn off power at your circuit breaker to the outlet(s) of the installation location.\nBring the dryer near the installation location.\nRemove the cap (if any is present) on the dryer's gas port.\nConnect the flexible gas line to the source port with enough length to reach the dryer's gas port.\nApply your compound of choice (pipe dope, or teflon tape) evenly to the male fittings of the gas line, and install the flexible gas line to dryer's gas port.\nOnce all fittings and connections are secure, spray soap-water solution on various areas of the joint fittings and turn the gas on.\nIf any of the joints begin to bubble, you'll need to disconnect and retighten them and/or apply new compound. Ensure the gas is turned off before disconnecting any fittings.\nShut off gas supply.\nConnect the dryer's exhaust hose to the vent leading outside, using only straight and elbow vents.\nInstall the hose to the exhaust vent of the dryer, and secure it with a clamp (screw-type recommended).\nEnsure the dryer is level on the ground, and then move it into its installation location.\nTurn on the gas and power supply.\nTest your gas dryer with a short cycle to ensure it's free of performance issues.\n\n\n\nHow to Maintain a Gas Dryer\nNow that your gas dryer is installed and ready to go, you need to know exactly how to maintain and look after it, so it can continue working and drying your clothes properly, for a long time to come!\n\nClean Lint Filter Regularly\nLint buildup in a dryer is prevalent, and bound to happen at some point. However, you can not only prevent an enormous buildup of lint from occurring, but you can also stop it at its head. Simply cleaning the lint filter out after each dryer use helps reduce the final amount that ends up in the exhaust of your dryer. And in the event that you need a new filter for your dryer, we at PartSelect have plenty, for whichever dryer model you may have!\n\nInspect Exhaust Hose\nThe exhaust hose for your dryer is where a good deal of lint and dust are expelled. Inspecting and cleaning both the inside tge exhaust hose from within your home at the dryer's end, and the other end outside of your home will keep any fire hazards or dryer performance issues away. It's recommended you inspect the exhausts at least once a month, or every few weeks.\n\nCheck Outside of Dryer for Lint Buildup\nYour laundry room, and the nooks and crannies within it, become a haven for dust and lint whether you like it or not. But, in order to have a well-functioning dryer, you need to do your part to make sure that the dirt, dust, and lint that builds up around it are removed. Otherwise, you run the risk of excessive humidity and fire occurring in and around the dryer, which will be extremely damaging to your and your home.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nFor all of your home improvement needs and appliance error code guides, make sure to check out our PartSelect blogs!

Two features that often catch users' attention are the tF and tC codes. These aren't error messages but display codes for the TurboFreeze and TurboCool settings. The TurboFreeze setting on a GE refrigerator helps freeze items quickly, while the TurboCool setting rapidly cools down the fridge section. In this article, we'll explore how these codes work and give you tips for using them effectively.\n\nWhat Do the tF and tC Codes Mean on GE Refrigerators?\nThe tF and tC codes on GE refrigerators are display codes for two special settings called TurboFreeze and TurboCool. When activated, these settings rapidly adjust the temperature in different compartments of the refrigerator to address particular cooling needs. But, many people think these codes mean something is wrong and try to fix them, even though they don't indicate any issues with the fridge. It's a common mistake that can cause confusion and unnecessary repairs.\n\nWhat is the TurboFreeze (tF) Mode on GE Refrigerators?\nTurboFreeze is a mode meant to quickly make the freezer colder. When you see the tF code, it means this feature is turned on. It's perfect for scenarios when you're opening the freezer door frequently or for extended periods, like when you're rearranging or cleaning it, hosting a large gathering, or need to rapidly cool down items, such as a bottle of wine or newly purchased groceries. The symbol for TurboFreeze might resemble 'EF,' an upside-down 'f' with an 'F,' or something similar. Just keep in mind that TurboFreeze won't make your ice maker work faster.\n\nWhat is the TurboCool (tC) Mode on GE Refrigerators?\nThis setting is for the refrigerator section, and when you see the tC code, it means this feature is active. It quickly lowers the temperature inside the fridge, which is handy when you've been opening the fridge door frequently, adding a lot of new food to the fridge (like after a big grocery shopping trip, storing a big batch of meals, or putting away warm leftovers). TurboCool is also helpful when your fridge experiences a power outage, as it helps bring the temperature back to normal quickly. You might spot a symbol like EC, an upside-down ‘f’ with a ‘C’ instead.\n\nHow Do the tF and tC Settings Work on GE Refrigerators?\nThe TurboFreeze and TurboCool settings on GE refrigerators focus on two main components: the compressor and the fans. When you turn on either of these settings, the compressor speeds up, and the fans start moving cold air more vigorously. This rapid action swiftly cools down the specific compartments: the tC setting targets the fresh food section, while the tF setting chills the freezer. As this happens, you'll see 'tF' or 'tC' on the display. You can even use these settings together at the same time for the most efficient cooling.\n\nHow to Use the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators\nHow to Use the tF Setting\n\nTo activate or deactivate TurboFreeze, press and hold the Freezer button for 3 seconds. On touch screen (LCD) models, select Express Mode instead.\nThe TurboFreeze setting will run for 8 hours by default, but you can manually turn it off if needed.\n\n\nHow to Use the tC Setting\n\nTo turn on or off TurboCool, follow a similar process: press and hold the Fridge button for 3 seconds. For touch screen (LCD) models, use the Express Mode button.\nTurboCool will automatically turn off after 2 hours, but you can turn it off manually by pressing and holding the Turbo Cool button for 3 seconds.\n\n\nIf you find that the tF or tC settings aren't working as expected, first, check for any power issues or control lock settings. If the temperature doesn't adjust properly, make sure there's no excessive frost buildup or blocked air vents. Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure these features work effectively, which includes cleaning the condenser coils and ensuring the door seals are intact.\n\nConsiderations to Using the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators\nNow that you understand how to use the tF and tC settings effectively, it's essential to understand some key considerations when using them. These will help you make the most of these features while ensuring your refrigerator runs efficiently and your food stays in excellent condition.\n\nNoise Level: These settings may make your refrigerator run a bit louder than usual because the compressor and fans work harder. If noise is a concern, especially during quiet times, consider using these settings when they are less disruptive.\nDuration of Settings: Remember to turn off the settings when they are no longer needed, as they use more energy.\nEnergy Costs: Frequent use of tF and tC settings can lead to higher energy bills over time. Be mindful of your energy usage and use these features judicially to balance convenience and cost.\nUsage Limitations: These features are designed for temporary use. Using them continuously can lead to increased energy consumption, overcooling (which may cause frost on food and wilting of fruits and vegetables), and greater wear on the refrigerator’s components.\nEffect on Other Foods: While tF and tC are great for cooling certain items quickly, they can accidentally freeze or over-chill other items in the fridge or freezer. Be mindful of where you place sensitive items like produce or liquids, as they can freeze or expand under these settings.\n\n\nDon’t stop here; to expand your understanding of appliance care and repair, explore our informative  how-to guides.

However, they're not to be used as a means of diet restriction. This article will dive into the three main types of fridge locks—padlock, combination, and strap locks—providing easy-to-follow advice on how to select, install, and maintain the right one for your home.\n\nCan You Put a Lock on a Refrigerator?\nMany people put locks on their fridges to keep their family safe. For households bustling with the energy of young ones or providing care for elderly family members, the kitchen can be a place of curiosity and potential hazards. Refrigerator locks act as a first line of defense against various dangers.\n\nYoung kids can accidentally climb inside a fridge, a rare but serious risk. Children may also unknowingly reach for things like prescription medicine or alcoholic beverages.\nElderly family members, particularly those with conditions like dementia or Alzheimer's, might accidentally consume spoiled food or misplace non-food items in the fridge.\n\n\nIt's important to note that refrigerator locks should not be used as a tool for diet management. Restricting access to food as a means of diet control can lead to unhealthy relationships with food and eating behaviors, especially in children. Fostering an environment that encourages healthy eating is a more effective approach. Here are some alternative solutions to consider: \n\n\nMindful Grocery Shopping: Avoid purchasing unhealthy or tempting items and focus on stocking your kitchen with nutritious foods.\nMeal Planning and Preparation: Plan and prepare meals in advance. This helps ensure a balanced diet and reduces  the tendency to opt for junk food.\nSetting Eating Schedules: Having fixed meal times can reduce random snacking. If everyone knows when to expect meals and snacks, they are less likely to eat out of boredom or impulse.\nCounseling or Dietician Consultation: For more challenging dietary management issues, professional advice from a nutrition expert or counselor can offer individualized strategies and support.\n\n\nTypes of Locks for a Refrigerator\nChoosing the right lock for your fridge is essential, as the market offers a variety of locks, each suited for different needs. There are three main types of locks:\n\nPadlock Locks: These traditional locks are well-known for their sturdiness. The downside is they require a key, which might be a problem if you're prone to misplacing things. Some homeowners might also find them less aesthetically pleasing.\nCombination Locks: Perfect for those who'd rather not bother with keys, combination locks secure your fridge with a numeric code. They strike a nice balance between security and convenience, but be careful not to forget the code. They might also cost a bit more than simple padlocks.\nStrap or Latch Locks: Made with a flexible strap or latch and strong adhesive, these locks are designed to be unobtrusive and child-friendly. They're generally easier to install and use but might not provide as much security against determined efforts to open them. They're great for keeping little ones out, but might not be as effective against adults or older kids. The adhesive also wears out over time.\n\n\nHow to Choose the Right Lock for a Refrigerator\nWhen it comes to picking out a fridge lock, there are a few key factors to keep in mind:\n\nType of Refrigerator: The kind of fridge you have matters. Whether it's a single door or a fancy French door, each style might need a different type of lock. Make sure the lock you choose fits well with your fridge's design.\nSecurity Level: Assess your security needs. For child safety, a basic strap lock might be enough. If you need more security, consider a padlock or combination lock.\nInstallation Ease: Some people prefer locks that are simple to install and remove, like strap locks. Others might want a more permanent fixture.\nAesthetics: The look of the lock can also be important. Choose one that matches well with your kitchen's style.\n\n\nHow to Put a Lock on a Refrigerator\nInstalling a refrigerator lock is often straightforward. Each lock generally comes with detailed instructions, and the installation typically requires only basic tools like a screwdriver. Here's a general guide:\n\nAlways start by thoroughly reading the provided instructions, taking the time to understand each step and any specific requirements or precautions.\nGather the necessary tools.\nBefore installation, clean the area of the fridge where the lock will be placed.\nFollow the instructions to attach the lock, whether it involves adhering a strap, positioning a padlock, or setting a combination.\nOnce installed, test the lock multiple times to ensure it functions correctly and provides the desired security.\n\n\nHow to Maintain a Lock on a Refrigerator\nTo ensure the longevity and effectiveness of your refrigerator lock, regular maintenance is key.\n\nRegular Inspection: Periodically check the lock for any signs of wear, damage, or loosening. For locks that use adhesive, check the adhesive pads to ensure they are still securely attached. Replace them if they begin to wear out.\nLubrication: For key-based locks, apply a small amount of lubricant like WD-40 every few months or as needed to maintain smooth operation.\nKey Management: For locks with keys, develop a system for storing keys where they are safe but accessible. Consider using a designated spot or a key ring for convenience.\n\n\n To find more ways to make your home safer and more efficient, check out our helpful  how-to guides. Identify common appliance problems, clear error codes, and replace parts with ease, all just a click away.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Once you've put in a new filter, you'll need to reset the indicator light. This can be done by holding down certain buttons (such as 'Filter Reset' or both 'Alarm' and 'Hold') or by going through the settings on your display panel. In this guide, we'll provide step-by-step instructions on how to reset it.\n\nWhat Does the Filter Indicator Light Look Like on a Samsung Refrigerator?\nThe filter indicator light on your Samsung refrigerator is shaped like a dotted square or grid with a small droplet at the bottom. The color of the light shows how soon you need to replace the water filter. When the filter is new, the light is blue or green. As you use the filter, the light will change color. It turns orange, pink, or purple after 5 months or 450 gallons of use, then red after 6 months or 500 gallons of use. When it turns red, you might also hear a chime or an alarm sound as a reminder to change the filter.\n\nOther clues that tell you that it's time to change the filter include changes in the taste or appearance of the water, such as finding particles in it. You might also notice the water dispensing more slowly or sputtering as it comes out.\n\nShould I Reset the Filter Indicator Light Without Changing the Water Filter on a Samsung Refrigerator?\nYou might wonder if it's possible to turn off the filter light without actually changing the water filter. Generally, there isn't an easy way to do this through the normal controls or settings. If you attempt to tamper with the filter light, it could mess with the accuracy of the filter status notification. You may not know when your filter really needs changing, and this can be harmful to your health. Old filters can get clogged with bacteria or mold, making the water unsafe to drink.\n\nHow to Reset the Filter Indicator Light on a Samsung Refrigerator\nSamsung fridges use many different water filters, so it's important to find the right one for your model. Our water filter finder can assist you with that. It's also wise to have your user manual close by. The manual gives instructions for your model on how to change the water filter and how to reset the filter indicator light afterward.\n\nNote: Some Samsung fridges have panels that lock automatically when not in use. If you try to use the panel and see a lock icon lit up, or if the panel only chimes when touched, it means the panel is locked. You'll need to unlock the panel first, then quickly follow the steps below before it locks again.\n\nHow to Unlock the Control Panel on a Samsung Refrigerator\nSamsung refrigerators have a few different types of lock features, depending on your model.\n\nAutomatic Control Lock:  This lock stops the control panels that are inside the fridge or on the top of a door to prevent accidental contact. You can unlock it by touching and holding the 'Door Alarm' button until you hear a chime.\nDispenser Lock: This lock disables the water and ice dispenser, but other parts of the control panel will still work. Check your model's user manual for exact instructions on how to unlock it.\nChild Lock or Control Lock: This lock stops both the control panel and the dispenser. It's found on panels outside of the fridge. To unlock, hold down the 'Ice Maker Off' button until you hear a chime.\n\n\nHow to Reset the Filter Indicator Light on a Samsung Refrigerator with a Single Reset Button\nJust press and hold the button named 'Filter Reset' for 3 to 5 seconds until you hear a \tchime. When you hear the chime, it means you've successfully reset the filter alarm system.\n\nHow to Reset the Filter Indicator Light on a Samsung Refrigerator with Two Reset Buttons\nCheck your user manual for specific instructions as different models have different button combinations to reset the filter light. Common button pairs for resetting the filter light are 'Fridge' and 'Power Cool', 'Alarm' and 'Hold', or 'Child Lock' and 'Ice Type'.\n\nPress both buttons at the same time and hold them down for 3 to 5 seconds until you hear a chime, which means the filter light has been reset.\n\nHow to Reset the Filter Indicator Light on a Samsung Refrigerator with a Control Panel with Arrows\n\nUse the arrow buttons on the panel to navigate to ‘More Options’.\nPress the ‘O’ button to select it.\nNow, find 'Filter Reset' and select it.\nFollow any further instructions shown on the panel's screen to complete the reset.\n\n\nHow to Reset the Filter Indicator Light on a Family Hub Samsung Refrigerator\n\nStart by tapping on 'Apps' on the smart display.\nThen, select 'Fridge Manager'.\nNext, choose 'Fridge Settings'.\nNow, tap on 'Water Filter', followed by 'Reset', and finally, 'Proceed'.\n\n\nHow to Reset the Filter Indicator Light on a Samsung Refrigerator Models RF4289 and RSG309\n\nFirst, find and select the Settings icon at the bottom of the display, then tap on ‘Water Filter’.\nOnce the water filter menu opens, tap ‘Next’ in the bottom right corner three times to get to the last page of the menu.\nNow, touch and hold the \"Reset the water filter\" option until the filter status changes.\nAfter \"Filter replaced\" shows up and then disappears, tap ‘Save’ in the bottom right corner of the display to complete the reset process.\n\n\nIs the Filter Indicator Light on a Samsung Refrigerator Still Red After Trying to Reset It?\nIf the indicator light stays red after repeating the steps outlined above, there's a chance you might have the wrong water filter for your fridge or it may not be installed properly. Ensure that the filter is pushed in all the way into its housing, then turned clockwise until the lock symbol aligns with the indicator line, or ensure it's securely fastened with its retaining clips. If you're still having trouble, it's always a good idea to refer to your user manual for assistance.\n\nReplacing your Samsung fridge's water filter and resetting the light is a simple but important task to keep your water clean.

This guide will walk you through the simple steps to deep clean your washer, whether it's a front-loader, a top-loader, or equipped with a self-clean cycle, using effective cleaners that are likely already in your cupboards, such as vinegar or bleach.\n\nWhy Should You Clean Your Washing Machine?\nIt's important to keep your washing machine clean for a few key reasons.\nFirst, the damp environment is ideal for germs and mold to grow. When they do, they can make your washing machine, and your clothes, start to smell musty. Secondly, every time you use laundry detergent and fabric softener, some of it doesn't rinse away and starts to build up inside the machine. This buildup can cause stains on your clothes that are hard to get out. It can also lead to mildew, which appears as black spots on your fabrics and can cause allergic reactions for some people.\nWhen you clean your washing machine regularly, you remove these lingering residues and stop mold in its tracks.\n\nHow Often Should You Clean Your Washing Machine?\nThe right cleaning schedule for your washing machine depends on the type and how you use it:\n\nStandard Washers: A thorough cleaning is advised at least twice a year to prevent residue from affecting the machine's performance and cleanliness of your clothes.\nMachines with Automatic Dispensers: If your machine has dispensers for things like detergent and fabric softener, you should clean these parts once a month. Doing so prevents these dispensers from getting blocked with dried-up product.\nHigh-Efficiency Washers: These machines are designed to save water and energy. The flip side is they can be more prone to residue buildup because they use less water. To prevent issues, clean your high-efficiency washer every three months. If you have hard water, or you use your washer a lot, you might need to clean it more frequently. Hard water has minerals that can create more residue, and heavy use can lead to more grime and odors.\n\n\nWhat Types of Cleaners Are There?\nWhen it's time to clean your washing machine, you have several options, ranging from homemade solutions to commercial cleaners. Each cleaner type has its strengths and specific uses:\n\nBleach: This is a strong and effective germ-killer and is particularly good for sanitizing your machine. When you need a thorough clean that tackles bacteria and viruses, bleach is a reliable option.\nVinegar: White vinegar is excellent for breaking down hard water deposits and soap scum. It's a natural descaling agent, which makes it useful for improving the efficiency of your machine. However, vinegar is less potent than bleach when it comes to killing germs.\nBaking Soda: This common household product is great for neutralizing odors and refreshing the inside of your washing machine. While it can help clean by gently scrubbing away dirt, it doesn’t offer the same level of disinfection or deep cleaning as bleach.\nCommercial Cleaners and Detergent Tablets: These are specifically formulated for washing machines, taking the guesswork out of the cleaning process. They often come as tablets or liquids and can be very convenient—just pop one into the machine and run a cycle.\n\nSafety Tip: Never mix bleach and vinegar. This combination creates dangerous chlorine gas, which can be harmful to breathe, even in small amounts. When using bleach, always ensure your space is well-ventilated, and if you switch to using vinegar afterward, make sure the bleach is completely rinsed away first.\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Clean Your Washing Machine\nNo matter what kind of washing machine you have at home, here are the basic tools you'll need to get it sparkling clean:\n\nCleaner of Your Choice (commercial cleaner, homemade mix, etc.)\nEmpty Spray Bottle (for your cleaning solution)\nScrubbing Brush or Soft Sponge (depending on the level of scrubbing needed)\nPutty Knife or Scraping Tool (for stubborn residue)\nSmall Bucket and Absorbent Towels (for water or spills)\n\n\nGetting Ready to Clean Your Washing Machine\nBefore you start cleaning, make sure to turn off your washing machine. Then carefully pull the plug out of the socket. This is a safety step to make sure you're not mixing water and electricity. Once unplugged, take the power cord and ensure it's not dangling where it could potentially get wet or trip someone. You can use a piece of tape to stick it up high on the back of the machine or somewhere else safe and dry.\n\nHow to Clean a Top-Load Washing Machine\nA thorough cleaning of your top-load washer means attending to the agitator, inner basket, and drain pump filter, along with the tub cover and machine's exterior.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nHow to Clean the Agitator on a Top-Load Washing Machine\n\nIf your machine has a compartment for fabric softener, take that piece out and let it soak in warm water and your chosen cleaning solution. Scrub away any residue after soaking.\nLook to see if the agitator in the middle is held down by a screw or if it can be lifted straight out. If you can remove it, do so carefully.\nThoroughly clean the agitator and the space beneath it with your preferred cleaner. If the agitator is in pieces, clean each one individually.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Tub Cover on a Top-Load Washing Machine\n\nAccess the tub cover by lifting the main top of the washing machine. Refer to your user guide for instructions on how to do this.\nClear out any obstructions in the drain holes and wash the tub cover with your chosen cleaning solution.\nIf the tub cover is removable, take it off to clean it, being careful with the rubber gasket that seals it.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Inner Basket on a Top-Load Washing Machine\n\nWith the tub cover off, you can now see and clean the upper part of the inner basket where grime can build up. Apply your cleaning solution and use a brush to scrub away any debris.\nClean the upper area of the outer tub where dirt can accumulate.\nCheck for any deposits around the water inlet area, spray on your cleaner, and clean thoroughly.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Drain Pump Filter on a Top-Load Washing Machine\n\nFind the filter, typically located at the bottom front of the washer, and prepare to catch water spillage with towels and a bucket.\nOpen the cover and if there's a hose, drain the water into your bucket.\nUnscrew and remove the filter, being mindful of any water that may escape.\nClean the filter of all foreign objects and rinse well with water, using your cleaner as needed.\nInspect and clean the filter housing, ensuring the seal is intact.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Outside of a Top-Load Washing Machine\n\nPrepare a cleaning mix with water and your preferred cleaner.\nWipe down the washer’s exterior surfaces, including the door and control panel, using a sponge.\nFor the door seal, gently wipe inside the folds to remove any trapped debris or buildup.\nDry all the surfaces with a clean towel.\n\n\nHow to Clean a Front-Load Washing Machine\nCleaning a front-loading washing machine involves attention to the dispenser tray, drum, door gasket, glass, drain pump filter, and exterior surfaces.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nHow to Clean the Dispenser Tray on a Front-Load Washing Machine\n\nSlide out the detergent dispenser as far as it goes and press the tab to fully remove it.\nSoak the tray in warm water mixed with your preferred cleaner for about 10 minutes.\nScrub with a cleaning brush to remove any buildup and rinse well.\nWipe the empty space in the machine where the tray goes with a damp cloth.\nSlide the clean dispenser tray back into place.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Tub on a Front-Load Washing Machine\n\nDistribute your chosen cleaning agent throughout the drum of the washer.\nRun the washer on the highest temperature setting.\nAfter the cycle, introduce another round of your cleaner into the drum and run a second hot cycle.\nPerform a final rinse cycle with just water to clear out any remaining cleaning agent.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Door Bellows on a Front-Load Washing Machine\n\nCreate a mixture with water and your selected cleaner.\nPull back the rubber seal around the door and apply the mixture with a cloth or soft brush.\nThoroughly clean the seal and wipe down any excess cleaner with a wet cloth.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Door Glass on a Front-Load Washing Machine\n\nFully open the door.\nApply your cleaner to the door glass.\nUse a cloth to clean the glass, making sure to remove any smudges or buildup.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Drain Pump Filter on a Front-Load Washing Machine\n\nLocate and open the compartment for the drain pump filter, which is typically at the front lower section of the washer.\nRemove the filter and take it to the sink, then use a brush with your cleaner to clean it.\nAfter cleaning, rinse and allow it to dry. Wipe the filter housing in the machine with a damp cloth using your cleaning mixture.\nOnce both the filter and housing are clean and dry, reinsert the filter and close the compartment.\n\n\nHow to Clean the Outside of a Front-Load Washing Machine\n\nPrepare a mixture of warm water and a small amount of your chosen cleaner.\nDip a sponge into the solution and wipe the entire exterior of the washer.\nWith a clean, damp cloth, go over the surfaces once more to remove any cleaner residue.\nUse a dry cloth to dry off the washer to complete the process.\n\n\nHow to Use the Self-Clean Cycle on a Washing Machine\nModern washing machines often come with a self-clean cycle, a feature designed to make maintenance easier and more efficient for users.\n\nHow to Use Detergent Tablets in a Washing Machine\nDetergent tablets, or washing machine cleaner tablets, are formulated to clean the inside of your washing machine. They often contain ingredients that break down the residue and are sometimes combined with a pleasant fragrance to leave your machine smelling fresh. Affresh is an example of a detergent tablet. Follow these steps to use them:\n\nCheck the manufacturer's instructions to see if they recommend using a tablet with the self-clean cycle—some may suggest it, while others may warn against it.\nIf using a tablet is recommended, simply place the tablet in the drum or detergent drawer (as directed by the tablet's packaging) before starting the self-clean cycle. The tablet will dissolve and circulate throughout the machine during the cycle, cleaning and deodorizing your washing machine.\n\n\nHow to Activate the Self-Clean Cycle on a Washing Machine\nTo activate the self-clean cycle, you'll usually find a button or a specific setting on your washing machine's control panel labeled 'Self Clean', 'Clean Washer', or something similar. Here’s what you typically need to do:\n\n\nLocate and select the self-clean cycle on your washing machine's setting. The cycle will use a preset program tailored to clean the machine itself.\nStart the cycle. It's best to let it run uninterrupted, and it might take more time than your regular laundry cycles.\n\n\nAdditional Maintenance Tips for Your Washing Machine\n\nAvoid Overloading Detergent: It might be tempting to add extra detergent for heavily soiled laundry, but this can actually lead to more residue and higher risk of malfunctions. Stick to the detergent amount recommended in the washer's manual.\nAllow for Airflow: After each wash, leave the machine door slightly open or lift the lid to promote air circulation. This simple step helps prevent the growth of mold and mildew by letting moisture evaporate. \nRemove Laundry Promptly: Don't let damp clothes sit in the machine after the cycle ends. Transferring them to the dryer or hanging them up to dry immediately will keep that musty odor at bay.\nDeal with Pet Hair and Debris: If you have furry friends at home, make sure to leave the door open until the drum is completely dry. Then, use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment to clear out any pet hair or debris.\nClean Spills Quickly: Lastly, maintain the cleanliness of your machine by wiping down the controls, door handle, and any areas where detergent or fabric softener has dripped with a damp cloth right away. This prevents sticky buildup and keeps your machine looking new.\n\n\nAfter following these steps, you might have noticed some worn out or damaged parts along the way. If that’s the case, don’t fret—we have genuine washer replacement parts that will fit your model and get your laundry routine back on track.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

It appears on both front load and top load washers and the troubleshooting steps are the same, regardless of the model that you own. The OE error is often caused by a kinked, improperly installed, or clogged drain hose; a dirty pump filter; or a faulty drain pump. This guide will help you drain the water from your washer and provide you with practical step-by-step solutions to get your washing cycle back on track. \n\nHow to Drain Water from Your LG Washer to Clear the OE Error Code\nThe OE error is triggered when the washer is not draining or is draining very slowly, and leaving water standing in the washer tub. This may be a simple problem that can be resolved by removing the water from the washer and then restarting the wash cycle. There are two main ways, listed below, that you can use drain the remaining water from your washer to clear the OE error.\n\nHow to Run a Spin Cycle to Drain the Water from Your LG Washer\n\n\nPower on the washer.\nPress the \"Special Use\" key until only the \"Spin Only\" option is illuminated.\nPress the \"Start/Pause\" button to begin the cycle.\n Your washer should then begin to drain the water that is inside the washer tub.\n\n\n\nIf your washer model does not have the \"Spin Only\" option follow the steps below to drain your washer.\n\n\nPower on the washer.\nSelect the wash cycle.\nPress the Start/Pause button to start the cycle.\nOnce the washer is running, press the Start/Pause button to pause the cycle.\nAfter 8-10 minutes the washer will time out and begin to drain on its own. This should clear OE error.\nRun an empty wash cycle to see if the washer is now functioning correctly. If the error occurs again, you will need to move through the troubleshooting steps below.\n\n\n\nCauses and Solutions for LG Washer OE Error\n\nLG Washer Repair Tip: Before doing any repairs, make sure to unplug the washing machine from the electrical outlet, and turn off the water supply to the washer. \n\nKinked or Clogged Drain Hose\nThe drain hose carries water out of the washer tub at the end of the wash cycle. The hose must be positioned correctly and free of obstructions to ensure water is pumped out and does not siphon back into the machine.The hose can become kinked if the washer is pushed back too close to the wall, or if there are items stored behind the washer that restrict the space available for the drain hose. If you are the proud owner of a new LG washer, the OE error may be caused by improper installation of the drain hose. On the other hand, the hose can become clogged with lint, hair, coins, buttons, or socks. If the hose is kinked or clogged, it will be unable to drain water from the washer or it will drain very slowly, leading to the OE error code. \n\nHow to Position Your Drain Hose to Avoid Kinks\n\n\nPull the washer away from the wall to ensure it is does not apply excess pressure to the drain hose.\nDo not use the space behind your washer for storage and be sure to remove any items that may have fallen and landed being the washer.\nEnsure the hose has a U-shaped bend, also know as a standpipe trap, before it goes into the drain. This prevents back flow from the drain into the washer.\nInsert the drain hose into the standpipe at the correct height, typically between 18 to 36 inches.\nAvoid using an excessively long drain hose. A long hose often creates loops, which might cause kinks or water trapping.\nWherever possible, maintain a straight path for the hose to avoid sharp bends which can restrict water flow.\n \n\n\nHow to Clean the Drain Hose to Clear OE Error\n\n\nLocate the drain hose at the back of the washing machine, and inspect it to ensure it is free of kinks or sharp bends.\nPlace a bucket or towels below the connection points.\nCompress the clamp that secures the hose to the back of the washer and slide it up the hose. \nCarefully pull the hose off the connection at the back of the washer.\nExamine the hose for any visible blockages, such as lint, coins, or other small items.\nIf there are obstructions inside the hose, run high pressure through the hose to force them out.\nIf the water does not force it out, use a long wire or brush to push out the obstructions. Be careful not to damage the hose.\nReconnect the drain hose and use the clamp to secure it in place.\nPlug the washing machine back in, turn on the water supply, and run a short cycle to see if the OE code has been resolved and the machine drains properly. \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nClogged Drain Filter\nThe pump filter, also known as the drain filter is designed to catch small items, lint, hair, and other debris that might get past the drum during a wash cycle, to prevent these items from reaching the drain pump and causing clogs or damage. A clogged filter can restrict  the water flow, leading to longer drain times or incomplete draining, which would trigger the OE error. You will need to clean to the filter to resolve the code. However, if the filter is damaged, you will need to replace the filter. \n\nHow to Clean a Clogged Drain Filter to Clear the OE Error\n\nOpen the small access door at the bottom front of the washer\nPlace a bucket or pan underneath the filter, remove the cap, and allow any water to drain out.\nOnce the water has drained out, gently turn the pump filter counterclockwise and pull it out.\nCheck the filter for any debris, lint, coins, or other obstructions, and clean it thoroughly.\nAfter cleaning, insert the filter back into its slot and turn it clockwise until it's tight. \nReinsert the drain tube and secure its cap. \nClose the access door. \n \n\n\nFaulty Drain Pump \nThe drain pump is responsible for pumping water out of the washer's drum through the drain hose and into the drainage system. The pump contains an impeller, which is a series of blades that spin and push the water through the pump and into the drain hose. If the pump has an electrical fault, becomes clogged or the impeller is damaged, the water won't drain correctly, leading to the OE error code. You can check if the drain pump is functioning correctly by either running a spin cycle, visually inspecting it, or testing it for continuity with a multimeter.\n\nHow to Test the Drain Pump Using a Spin Cycle\n\n\nEnsure the washer is switched on.\nPress and hold the button labeled \"Spin Speed\" until it is set to \"High\".\nPress the \"Start/Pause\" button to begin the \"Spin Only\" cycle.\nIf you hear a humming sound coming from the washer, then the drain pump is functioning.\nHowever, if there is no sound or you hear unusual noises, then you will likely need to manually inspect the drain pump.\n\n\n\nHow to Access the Drain Pump in an LG Washer \n\n\nDepending on your washer model, you may be able to access the drain pump either by removing the front access panel or by removing the rear panel. Either way, you will typically find it mounted to the bottom of the washer.\nPull the washer from the wall to access the water supply hoses, and disconnect them.\nExamine both the pump’s inlet and outlet to see if there may be any items creating a blockage.\nRemove the mounting hardware that holds the pump in place and slide the pump off the motor shaft to examine it more thoroughly.\nIf your washer has its own pump, you will need to remove the filter screen to verify that the pump is not clogged. \nIf there are no visible obstructions and you hear the motor running, the impeller might be damaged. If it is, the pump will need to be replaced.\nIf the pump is clean and the impeller is not damaged, you will need to test the pump motor (if it has its own motor) for continuity using a multimeter.\n\n\n \nHow to Test the Drain Pump with a Multimeter\n\n\nYou may need to refer to the wiring diagram for your model to determine the correct terminals to test.\nSet the multimeter to the continuity setting, and touch the multimeter probes to the pump's terminals.\nIf there is no reading, or the reading is not within the correct range, you will need to replace the drain pump.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Drain Pump to Clear OE Error \n\n\nSimply discard the old drain pump and place the new one in its position.\nReattach the water supply hoses and secure them with the appropriate clamps.\nReconnect the wiring harness, and secure the pump with mounting hardware.\nReattach the front access panel or the rear panel.\nOnce you've replaced the pump, plug the washing machine back in, turn on the water supply, and run a short cycle to ensure the washer drains correctly and that the OE code no longer appears.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nControl Board Glitch \nAlthough it is rare, the control board may be the cause of the OE error on your LG washer. The control board controls the functions of the washer. When the washing or rinsing cycle is complete the control board sends a signal to the drain pump to activate and drain water out of the tub. If it experiences a minor glitch, it may be unable to send this signal, resulting in the OE error code.\n\nHow to Reset Your LG Washer to Fix OE Error\n\n\nPress the Power button to turn off the washer.\nDisconnect the washer from the power outlet.\nTurn the washer off at the circuit breaker and wait approximately 3 - 5 minutes before turning it on at the circuit breaker again.\nReconnect the washer to the power outlet.\nPress the Power button to restart the washer.\nCheck that the OE error has been resolved and resume regular use of your washer. \n\n\n\nHow to Clean Your LG Washer after Clearing the OE Error\nOnce the OE error code is resolved, you may need to clean out your washer tub to avoid unpleasant smells from moisture buildup.\n\nTurn the washer on and remove any items inside the tub.\nSelect the \"Tub Clean\" cycle.\nTake your tub cleaner and follow the instructions on the package. If it is a powder or liquid cleaner pour it into the appropriate part of the detergent dispenser and if it's a tablet, place it directly in the washer tub.\nPress the Start/Pause button to start the cycle.\nOnce the cycle is complete, open the washer door and detergent dispenser, and let the washer dry completely before using it again.\n\n\n\nThe OE error code, while intimidating at first glance, is your LG washing machine's way of communicating a drainage issue. By regularly checking the drainage hose and filter, you can avoid encountering this error in the future. However, if the problem persists even after following the recommended steps, it might be time to consult with a professional or contact LG customer service. Remember, regular maintenance is key to ensuring the longevity and efficiency of your appliance.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

An F3 code may also appear with an 'E' code on some models, which is denoted with a number 1–4. It is important to solve this issue quickly, as operating with a bad temperature sensor or control board can become a safety hazard. The first thing you can do to resolve this error code is to do a simple power reset. But if the code reappears, you'll need to look at replacing one of the previously mentioned components. But don't worry, we have the step-by-step repair guide you need to fix your Whirlpool range so you can get back to cooking and baking!\n\nWhat Does Whirlpool Range Error Code F3 Mean?\nThe F3 error code signifies an issue with the temperature sensor(s) within the oven, however, the internal wiring and control board are also possible causes for this error. With some range models, the oven door will lock if the oven senses its temperature is exceeding what is safe for operation so as to prevent a safety hazard, or if the oven believes it's entering a 'Self Clean' mode. Even if the internal temperature isn't as dangerously high as the oven senses, the door can still lock if the temperature sensor is failing and inaccurately detecting the temperature. If this happens, you will need to reset the range or begin the repair process.\n\nAs mentioned above, you may simply get an 'F3' error code, or with some Whirlpool range models you may see an 'F3' code with an accompanying 'E' code. The following is a list of the accompanying 'E' codes and what they mean:\n\n\nE0, E1: This code signifies an issue with the oven temperature sensor, its wiring, and/or the control board.\nE2: This code means there's a problem with the oven temperature sensor, the warming drawer sensor, and/or the wiring for them both.\nE3: This code indicates an issue with the oven temperature sensor, or its wiring.\nE4: This code is indicating the need for the meat temperature sensor probe to be securely inserted into its receptacle.\n\n\n\nHow to Reset a Whirlpool Range to Solve an F3 Error\nThe first and most simple solution to a Whirlpool range F3 error code is to simply reset the range. This can be done by either disconnecting the power cord from the wall outlet, or turning the range's breaker off and then on. After the range has been reset, it's important to set the oven to bake for 10 minutes and monitor it to check whether the F3 error code returns. Place a thermometer within the oven to test its temperature as well, to test whether it accurately senses the correct temperature. If the F3 error code returns and if the internal temperature is too high or too low, your issue lies with either the temperature sensor or the control board.\n\nHow to Fix or Replace a Whirlpool Range Temperature Sensor to Solve an F3 Error\nIf after resetting your Whirlpool range you are still receiving an F3 error code, the temperature sensor is the simplest and most cost-efficient part you can replace to fix the issue outright. Depending on your Whirlpool range model, you may have multiple sensors to replace, however, finding the right OEM temperature sensor for your Whirlpool range is simple with PartSelect's huge part inventory, and replacing it is even easier with the following guide:\n\n\n\nEnsure the range is disconnected from the wall outlet.\nPull the range out from the wall.\nUnthread and disconnect the back panel of the range.\nLocate the sensor and disconnect its wire harness.\nAt this point, you can inspect the wiring for any visible issues, and to test the sensor with a multimeter (set to Ohms) to check its continuity.\nIf the sensor's Ohm reading is on or around 1100 Ohms, it's fine. However, if it's significantly lower or not returning any reading, it needs replacing.\nIf the sensor's reading comes back normal, unthread the sensor, remove it, and clean it thoroughly, before reinstalling it and testing your oven once more.\nIf the sensor is bad, unthread its securing screws and remove it.\nConnect the new sensor's wire harness and install into the appropriate port, and secure it with the proper mounting screws.\nReinstall the back panel of the range and install the range back into its appropriate position.\nSet the oven to bake for 10 minutes and if the F3 error code reappears, replace its control board.\n\n\n\nThe following is a general video guide to provide assistance for this repair.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Whirlpool Range Control Board to Fix an F3 Error\nIf your Whirlpool range's temperature sensor has been replaced and the F3 error code reappears, the issue lies solely with the control board of the range. This repair can be more difficult than replacing the temperature sensor, but is still quite doable for any repair person. The only requirements to do this repair are an OEM Whirlpool range control board to replace your current one, and a step-by-step guide like the following one:\n\n\n\nDisconnect the range from the wall outlet.\nRemove the range from its position against the wall.\nDisconnect the back panel of the range by unthreading any securing screws.\nLocate the control board and disconnect all wire harnesses connected to it. Note: Before completing this step, ensure you take pictures or notes of the control board's wiring to make the future reinstallation easier.\nNow, unthread the old control board's securing screws.\nWith the old control board unthreaded and disconnected, remove it from the range.\nInstall the new control board and connect its wire harnesses.\nSecure the control board with its mounting screws.\nReconnect the back panel of the range, and slide the range back into place.\nSet the oven to bake for 10 minutes to ensure the success of the installation process.\n\n\n\nThe following video is a general guide for replacing control boards on Whirlpool ranges.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat if the F3 Code Reappears on Your Whirlpool Range?\nIf you're still finding your Whirlpool range is receiving an F3 error, even after replacing its temperature sensor and control board, your next best option is to contact your local certified repair technician for a diagnosis of your range. However, the quickest and most cost efficient solution at that point is to replace your range in its entirety, so you can get a working range as quickly as possible.\nFor all other appliance repair and home improvement guides, be sure to check out our other PartSelect blogs.

Refrigerator compressors normally produce a low humming noise during various portions of the day, since they're essentially the refrigerator's motor. The evaporator also produces noise, although it's usually not as loud as the compressor is. However, if there is a louder-than-usual hum coming from your refrigerator, it may be a sign of frost buildup around the evaporator, or an aging and failing compressor. Then, if you are hearing extremely loud humming noises, there may be an issue with the condenser or evaporator fan that we will break down for you how to fix below, along with step-by-step video guides!\n\nRefrigerator Noise Meanings\nOccasional, low noises coming from your refrigerator are completely normal, and nothing to be concerned about – but there are definitely some noises that you will want to take more seriously than others. Here is a list of most refrigerator noises you'll hear, and what they mean:\n\n\n\nQuiet Hum/Buzz: A low, quiet or subtle hum/buzz is a normal occurrence for most refrigerator models. This hum may be accompanied by a winding noise when the compressor turns on.\nLoud Hum/Buzz: A louder hum or buzz may be an indication that the compressor is being overworked, meaning it could be dirty and needs cleaning, or if there is something warm left in the refrigerator and now the motor has to overcompensate to keep the fridge cool. It may also be the ice maker trying to produce ice, but if you don't have a water line connected to your fridge, ensure this is turned off.\nVery Loud Hum: If your refrigerator is consistently producing a loud hum or buzz noise from its bottom and/or rear side, it means the compressor is likely failing and in need of service or replacement. A hum of this level will usually only come from an older refrigerator model, since most fridge models last between 15-20 years.\n\n\n\nHow to Fix a Refrigerator Evaporator Fan to Solve Loud Humming Noises\nIf the evaporator fan in your refrigerator is blocked by ice, if its airway is blocked by food items, or if its motor is bad and needs replacing, your refrigerator will begin to hum or buzz loudly. Luckily, the evaporator can be fixed, and doing so is a repair that anyone can do!\n\nRemove Food Items from Evaporator Fan\nDepending on your refrigerator model, food items can block and clog the airway of the evaporator fan, preventing it from properly distributing cool air within the cabinet of the refrigerator and causing both the compressor and evaporator to work harder and hum or buzz distinctly loud. Simply moving food out of the way of the fan and clearing off any built-up frost should fix the humming and noise issue.\n\nThaw and Remove Ice from Evaporator Fan\nEvaporator fans help maintain the internal temperature in your refrigerator. They pull warm air from the appliance through the evaporator coils to cool it. Depending on the model of refrigerator, the evaporator fan motor may also be used to circulate that cooled air. However, if the defrost system malfunctions or if any parts within it don't work properly, the fan mechanism will experience frost buildup and produce a humming or buzzing noise. If your refrigerator is experiencing defrost issues and significant frost buildup, we have a general how-to guide on how to fix it!\n\n\n\nLocate the evaporator fan. The evaporator fan is normally located in the freezer cabinet or compartment.\nRemove any food items or shelves blocking the fan.\nUnthread and remove any panels covering the fan.\nOnce you gain access to the fan, use a hair dryer or similar tool to thaw any built-up ice or frost around the fan.\nUse a towel to soak up and remove any moisture from the fan area.\nOnce all ice or frost is melted, ensure the fan moves freely before reinstalling the cover panel.\nIf the fan does not move freely, you will likely need to replace the evaporator fan motor.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace an Evaporator Fan Motor\nIf the evaporator fan blade does not move freely within the evaporator mechanism, it means that the motor is bad or broken and needs replacing in order to function properly. Fortunately, we have a huge inventory of OEM refrigerator evaporator fan motors, and the guide you need to properly replace it:\n\n\nLocate your refrigerator's evaporator fan and gain access to it by removing any food items or shelves in front of it and unthreading any cover panels.\nDisconnect any wire harnesses to the fan motor and unthread its housing to remove it.\nRemove the fan's blade and and unthread the motor from its housing.\nInstall the new motor and ensure it's secure within its housing.\nSeat and install the housing within the appropriate compartment.\nConnect the necessary wire harnesses and screws.\nReconnect any cover panels and install previously removed shelves and their food items.\n\n\n\nBelow is a general video guide showing how to replace a refrigerator evaporator fan motor.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Fix the Defrost System to Solve Frost Buildup\nThe defrost system within your refrigerator, made up of the defrost timer, thermostat, and heater, is designed to melt ice and frost buildup within the cooling systems of the fridge. This is done to ensure your food items are kept cold at all times, without the risk of frost or ice building up and causing issues. If either of these parts fails or stops working properly, ice and frost will buildup and the evaporator fan will eventually begin making a humming or buzzing noise.\n\nHow to Replace a Defrost Thermostat to Fix Refrigerator Frost Buildup\nFor this repair, you will need a screwdriver, and you may require a wire stripper and crimper, heat-shrinking tubes, a heat gun, and a new defrost thermostat which you can find in our wide range of OEM refrigerator thermostats.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your fridge from its wall outlet.\nLocate the evaporator fan and remove any shelves and food items to access it.\nUnthread any cover panels to the evaporator.\nLocate the thermostat within the evaporator assembly.\nIf the thermostat has an easy-access plug, unplug it and and plug in the new thermostat and skip to step . If not, cut the old wire and remove it.\nStrip a small part of the wire from the wiring harness from the fridge and from the new thermostat.\nAttach the new wire leads together and crimp them, and apply heat shrink tubing over each connected wire.\nWith all wires connected properly, secure them as they were and resecure the evaporator cover.\nPlug your refrigerator back in and leave it to see whether the frost returns.\n\n\n\nBelow is a general video guide on how to replace the defrost thermostat.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Defrost Heater to Fix Refrigerator Frost Buildup\nIf you've replaced the defrost thermostat and frost is continuing to buildup, it's likely an issue with the defrost heater, which is supposed to activate and melt any and all ice or frost. Replacing this part is not difficult, and likely will only require a screwdriver and a new defrost heater which you can find in our selection of OEM refrigerator elements and burners.\n\n\n\nDisconnect your refrigerator from its wall outlet.\nLocate the defrost evaporator coil assembly in your refrigerator. This is normally located in the freezer compartment. You may need to empty the compartment to access the evaporator assembly.\nUnthread and remove the cover panel of the evaporator assembly.\nDepending on your model, the visual appearance and complexity of your defrost heater may differ.

However, the reverse – using a dryer cord for your range – is not safe. This guide will help you choose a range cord that suits your dryer, ensuring it has the right voltage and amperage rating, as well as a compatible receptacle. You’ll also learn how to switch out your dryer’s cord safely.\n\nUnderstanding Dryer Power Cords\nNowadays, many electric dryers don't come with power cords because homes have different types of outlets. This lets homeowners choose cords that fit their electrical setups and reduces compatibility issues. Let’s look at some common features of these power cords:\n\nProng Types of Power Cords\nRange cords can have either 3 prongs or 4 prongs. If your house was built before 1996, you’re probably using 3-prong cords. But if your house is newer, you’re likely using 4-prong cords because of a National Electric Code (NEC) update in 1996 that required an additional wire specifically for grounding.\n\nVoltage and Amperage of Power Cords\nWhen selecting a power cord, it's helpful to understand two key terms:\n\nVoltage is the measure of electrical potential between two points in a circuit. It is the force that pushes electricity through wires, like how water pressure moves water through a hose.\nAmperage, or current, is the measure of the flow of electric charge through a conductor, like the amount of water flowing through that hose.\n\n\nTypically, electric range cords are designed for 240-volt circuits and have a higher amperage rating of 50 amps compared to cords for electric dryers, which are usually rated at 30 amps. This difference in power handling capabilities is crucial for safe appliance operation.\n\nPlug Designs of Power Cords\nMany range cords feature plugs that bend at a right angle. This design ensures that the cord remains securely plugged in and flush against the wall, reducing the chances of it getting accidentally unplugged.\n\nCan You Use a Range Cord on a Dryer?\nBecause range cords can handle a higher amperage rating of 50 amps than dryer cords, which are typically rated at 30 amps, it is possible to use range cords on dryers. However, dryer cords cannot be used on ranges. Doing so can result in potential safety hazards, including overheating, electrical fires, and damage to your range.\n\nWhile it is typically possible to use a range cord on a dryer, there are a few things you need to check to ensure it's safe and compatible.\n\nChecking the Voltage Rating of the Range Cord\nFirstly, verify that the voltage rating of the range cord matches that of your dryer. Usually, dryer cords and range cords are designed for 240-volt circuits.\n\nUnderstanding the Amperage Rating of the Range Cord\nAmperage rating, or the amount of power the cord can handle, is also crucial. Typically, electric range cords are rated for a higher power (50 amps) as opposed to dryer cords (30 amps). Again, it's not advisable to use a dryer cord for a range, as it may not support the range's higher power requirement.\n\nMatching the Receptacle of the Range Cord\nLastly, ensure that the receptacle (the wall socket) where you'll plug in the dryer matches the range cord's specifications. If the cord doesn’t match your home’s receptacle, you may need to use an adapter or covert the setup (for example, changing a 3-prong cord to a 4-prong one).\n\nHow to Choose and Install a Power Cord on Your Dryer\nUsing the wrong cord can lead to serious risks like electrical fires or damage to your appliance. To pick the correct cord for your dryer,  follow these simple steps before making your purchase:\n\n\nExamine the Outlet: Look closely at the dryer’s outlet to determine the cord type needed.\nTake Reference Photos: Snap pictures of the outlet and how your dryer is currently set up. These can be valuable references when you're shopping for a new cord.\nMeasure the Cord: To avoid ending up with a cord that's too short, measure your existing one to determine the minimum length required for the replacement cord.\n\n\nSafety Precautions Before Replacing Your Dryer's Power Cord\n\nInstall a Strain-Relief Fitting: This is a small but important component that attaches to your cord to prevent it from pulling loose from the dryer. It's typically a small, often cylindrical or elongated piece made of plastic or metal. The strain-relief fitting helps alleviate tension on the wire connections, when the dryer is moved. It usually consists of two parts: a nut and a bushing or clamp.\nConnect Before Plugging In: Always remember, never plug in your dryer until the cord is entirely and correctly connected. All wire connections should be firmly secured to prevent short circuits or sparking.\n\n\nHow to Replace the Power Cord on Your Dryer\nTo safely replace your dryer cord, follow these easy instructions:\n\nStart by disconnecting the dryer from the power source.\nLocate the terminal block, which is typically found in the back access panel of your dryer, where the cord connects.\nCarefully unscrew and detach the old cord from the terminal block.\nIf you have a 3-prong cord, attach the middle or ground wire to the center terminal and the outer wires to the right and left terminals.\nIf you have a 4-prong cord, connect the white wire to the center neutral terminal, the red and black wires to the respective right and left hot terminals, and the green wire to the grounding screw or dryer case.\nFasten the strain-relief fitting at the point where the cord enters the dryer to prevent it from moving.\nReplace the access panel and double-check all connections to ensure they are secure and in their correct positions.\nFinally, plug your dryer back into the outlet and test it to confirm that it operates correctly.\n\n\nAs we wrap up, remember the importance of choosing the right power cord for your appliance. Our genuine range power cords are a great pick – easy to use and perfect for keeping your dryer running smoothly and safely.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Not only is there a mess to clean up, but it also means that your dishwasher is going to need some maintenance. Or perhaps you’ve woken up in the morning to discover the cycle never finished and there’s an error code flashing on your dishwasher’s display. If you are seeing “F2” or two flashing lights from your Whirlpool dishwasher, it means that you have a leak. Unfortunately, this won’t tell you where the leak is coming from, you’ll have to open up the machine and inspect further for that. The information below will help you troubleshoot the source of your leak, show you how to replace any damaged parts, and get your dishwasher back in action.\n\nPlease note that this information is related to correcting an F2 error code concerning a leak. Depending on your model, this error code will show up on your display as “F2” or you may see two flashing lights. Newer models of Whirlpool dishwashers have larger displays, and more detailed error codes. If your Whirlpool dishwasher is displaying “F2E1” or “F2E2” this is related to a User Interface issue, and not a leak.\n\n \nHow to Prevent a Whirlpool Dishwasher F2 Error Code\n\nThe first item you should check in your Whirlpool dishwasher is the filter. If you have not been regularly cleaning out the filter, food particles will begin to clog it up, and water will not drain from your machine properly. Keeping the filter clean will help keep other components of your dishwasher, like the drain pump, running more efficiently. If this task isn’t currently part of your cleaning routine, add it to your list at least once per month! If you scrape your dishes before loading, you can help prevent these clogs from happening.\n\nThe next item to check is if your dishwasher is level. If the machine wasn’t installed properly, water could be pooling, it won’t drain fully, and could cause a leak. Check that the machine is level from front to back, and from side to side, and make adjustments to the leveling legs if necessary.\n\nThe final preventative maintenance item to avoid dishwasher leaks is to ensure that you’re using the proper detergent. Excess suds will lead to leaks, so it is important to use the correct quantity of detergent in your machine. Whirlpool recommends pods or tablets for their machines, but powder or liquid detergent will also work. If you have hard water, a powder detergent works well against mineral buildup, whereas soft water supplies may clean better with liquid or pods. Note that liquid dishwasher detergent is different from the dish soap you use in the sink – it is designed to not bubble and suds up. Using dish soap in your dishwasher will create way too many bubbles, and those bubbles will likely leak out of the machine all over your floor.\n\nFinding the Source of Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Leak\n\nIf you are able to catch the leak in action, the location the water is coming from can give you some clues as to what is causing the leak. If the water is leaking out from around the door, it is likely an issue with the door gasket or seal, the spray arm, or the float. If the water is coming from underneath the machine, there is likely an issue with the drain pump, the hose or its connections, or the water inlet valve.\n\nParts to Inspect to Clear a Whirlpool Dishwasher F2 Error Code\n\nBefore you begin inspecting any components of your Whirlpool dishwasher, begin by disconnecting the power and turning off the water supply.\n\nDrain Pump\n\nA clogged pump, or one that has become defective, won’t be able to drain the water from your dishwasher, which may result in a leak if there is too much water in the machine. If the leak is coming from underneath the dishwasher, it is a good indicator that the pump may be the problem. The drain pump is normally found behind the access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher.\n\nHow to Inspect a Drain Pump\n\nIf the drain pump is clogged up with food debris, you can clean this out (along with the dishwasher’s filter) and your machine should drain normally again. If there are no visible clogs, you can use a multimeter to test if the pump is faulty. Set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the terminals with the probes to test for continuity. If you get a reading of anything besides “zero” you will need a replacement drain pump.  \n\nHow to Replace a Drain Pump on a Whirlpool Dishwasher \n\nIf you need to replace the pump on your dishwasher, this video will walk you through the steps of that repair.\n\n \n \n\n\n \nDoor Gasket\n\nThe door gasket on your dishwasher is used to create a watertight seal when the door is closed. The gaskets or door seals are typically made of rubber or vinyl, both of which can become brittle and crack over time and won’t create a proper seal, allowing water to leak out of the dishwasher.\n\nHow to Inspect a Door Gasket\n\nFirst check that there isn’t food or debris stuck in the gasket. Crumbs can prevent the door from sealing properly, which may be causing your leak. If cleaning the gasket doesn’t fix the issue, check to see if there are any cracks or damaged pieces. If a new part is required, you can find a replacement gasket here.\n\nHow to Replace a Door Gasket on a Whirlpool Dishwasher \n\nIf you need a new door gasket, begin by removing the damaged piece and cleaning the channel of any debris before installing the new gasket.\n\n \n \n\n\n \nWater Inlet Valve\n\nThe purpose of the water inlet valve is to connect your main water line to your dishwasher. If the leak is coming from underneath the machine and the drain pump wasn’t to blame, there may be an issue with the water inlet valve. A faulty valve may be letting too much water into your machine, causing a leak to happen.\n\nHow to Inspect a Water Inlet Valve \n\nThe water inlet valve can be found behind the access panel at the base of your dishwasher. First check to ensure that the water supply lines are connected properly. Next check the valve for any signs of cracks or other damage, or indications that the valve is leaking. If you notice any of these, you will need to get a replacement water inlet valve.\n\nHow to Replace a Water Inlet Valve on a Whirlpool Dishwasher\n\nTo replace the water inlet valve, you may find it easier to remove the dishwasher from underneath the cabinet. The water supply line will have to be disconnected from the valve, be sure to have the water turned off prior.\n\n \n \n\n\n\nSpray Arm\n\nIf the spray arm in the dishwasher is clogged or damaged, it can alter the direction that the water sprays out of it. This can result in water hitting the dishwasher door at an abnormal angle, and water can leak out. This is more likely to occur along the bottom of the door where there isn’t a gasket to seal against the water.\n\nHow to Inspect a Spray Arm\n\nThe spray arm easily removes from the bottom of the dishwasher. Visually inspect the holes on the spray arm for clogs and clear out the debris if necessary. If it is cracked or warped, you will need a replacement spray arm.\n\nHow to Replace a Spray Arm in a Whirlpool Dishwasher\n\nDepending on your dishwasher model, the lower spray arm may be threaded in place or simply just pull right out of the machine.\n\n \n \n\n \n\nFloat and Float Switch\n\nThe float and float switch work together to prevent your dishwasher from overfilling with water. Once the appropriate water level has been reached, the float trips the switch to signal the machine to stop filling. If either of these components are faulty, the dishwasher may continue to fill which would result in a leak.\n\nHow to Inspect a Float Switch\n\nYou will need to use a multimeter to inspect the float switch for continuity. Set the multimeter to Rx1 and touch the probes to the switch’s terminals. The reading should be either zero or infinity. With the probes still in contact, press the button on the switch – the reading should now be the opposite (zero to infinity, or infinity to zero). If you do not receive these readings, then it is faulty and you will need a new float switch.\n\nHow to Replace a Float Switch in a Whirlpool Dishwasher\n\nIf you need to replace the float switch in your dishwasher, you may find it easier to work on if the dishwasher is pulled out from underneath the cabinet.\n\n \n \n\n\n \nHoses and Clamps\n\nThe hose clamps are used to secure the drain and circulating hoses to the dishwasher’s pump. If the clamps have become loose, or the hoses are cracked, this may be the source of your leak.\n\nHow to Inspect the Hoses and Clamps\n\nSince the hoses and clamps are attached to the pump, you can find them behind the access panel at the base of your dishwasher. Check the clamps to ensure they’re secure and tighten up if necessary. Inspect the hoses for any cracks or damage. You could remove the hoses from the machine and run water through them to see if there are any leaks. If you discover any issues, you’ll want to replace the hoses and clamps.\n\nHow to Replace a Hose Clamp on a Whirlpool Dishwasher\n\nIt will be easiest to replace the dishwasher hoses and clamps if the machine is pulled out from underneath the cabinet.\n\n \n \n\n \n\nWhile seeing water on your kitchen floor may be unsettling, resolving the F2 error code on your Whirlpool dishwasher isn’t a difficult task. Many of the causes of a leak are preventable with regular cleaning and proper use of your machine, and parts that may have failed are a simple DIY repair. If working through the above list still hasn’t cleared the F2 error code, the next step would be to call in a certified appliance technician to diagnose your dishwasher.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

There are a few reasons why your ice maker isn't working properly, some are easy fixes, and others require parts and tools! You can start by lowering the temperature of your freezer to below 0°F/-18°C, ensuring the shutoff switch/arm is not engaged, or emptying the ice maker bin. Then you can check the ejector fingers, water supply and tube, and infrared sensor to ensure those are not the cause. Finally, it's important to troubleshoot key parts like the water filter, door switch, ice dispenser paddles and water inlet valve if basic troubleshooting does not solve the issue. Whether it's a quick and easy fix, or a faulty part, we have the guide to walk you the steps required to get your ice maker up and running again!\n\nQuick Ice Maker Fixes\nIce makers can be finicky, since they rely on consistently cold temperatures and key mechanical functions to turn over continuously day and night, making ice. Unfortunately, these functions can be interrupted by any slight fluctuation or disruption. However, the good news is these issue are often just as easy to fix as they are to occur. The following are the simplest common fixes to an ice maker that isn't functioning:\n\n\n\nShutoff Arm/Switch is Not Engaged: The shutoff arm/switch in many freezer compartments directly activates and deactivates the ice maker, and can accidentally be lodged into an, 'OFF' position. This switch is normally behind or around the ice bin, however your model may be different. Simply turn this arm/switch to the correct position to turn it on again.\nIce Maker Bin is Frozen: Referred to as, 'compacting', this is when a lack of movement, production or proper cleaning of the ice bin leads to it clumping together and freezing into a solid block. This results in the ice maker appearing to be broken, when in reality, the old ice just needs to be thrown out.\nTemperature of Freezer is too High: When a freezer compartment's temperature is too warm or too cold, it can result in too small of ice or ice not being produced at all, or it can result in the entire ice bin freezing and being difficult to separate. Using a thermometer, you can test the internal temperature of the freezer compartment to ensure it's 0°F/-18°C or slightly colder. If the internal temperature is too high or too cold, use your fridge controls to adjust the temperature.\nFrozen Water Supply: The water supply tube within an ice maker system is responsible for delivering water to the ice maker to freeze. This tube can freeze when there's a momentary lack of water pressure, a clogged water filter within the fridge, or a lapse within the temperature control of the freezer. However, if you pull out the ice bin, and using a hair dryer or similar tool, you can apply heat to the tube and de-thaw it, allowing the water to flow freely again. Note: Move the hair dryer and apply heat indirectly, since too much direct heat may cause the plastic to melt.\n\n\n\nSometimes fixing your ice maker isn't as easy as the four methods described above. The following issues may require more time to fix, but are just as important to the functionality of your ice maker:\n\n\n\nEjector Fingers: In some fridge models a mechanism called, ejector 'fingers' – also known as bar, tines, or paddles – is used to eject the frozen ice created by the ice maker into the ice bin. This mechanism can become jammed and will require you to break-up the ice to become unstuck.\nClogged or Kinked Water Tube: A clogged or kinked water supply tube to your fridge will inevitably and naturally cause the ice maker to stop producing ice. If the temperature in your fridge is suitable and it suddenly stops producing ice, check the water supply tube for any clogs, kinks, or damage.\nInfrared Sensor Out of Position: In some Samsung refrigerator models, infrared sensors are used to detect when more ice needs to be made, and when it needs to stop. If the sensor is dislodged, it will inaccurately detect ice and cause the ice maker to stop. Simply remove any built-up or lodged ice, and the sensor should restore functionality to the ice maker.\n\n\n\nParts to Examine to Fix Your Ice Maker\nIf you've tried all of the above methods, and your ice maker is still not producing ice or working properly, you likely have the bigger task ahead of you – replacing a part. We understand that this is not good news, but we have the step-by-step guide you need to properly repair your fridge, and get cold ice now!\n\n\nHow to Replace a Clogged or After-Market Water Filter\nWater filters are used for the dispensing of water and the creation of ice in the ice maker. If your filter is clogged or is an after-market variant, it will need to be replaced with an OEM filter immediately. Locating the filter in your refrigerator can depend on the model, however, key places to look for are the ceiling of the fridge's interior, as well as the bottom of the appliance or corners. You can find the OEM filter for your fridge model in our PartSelect water filter finder!\n\nWater filters should be changed every 6–9 months for best water taste and appearance. Not changing your water filter will cause sediments and other normally filtered elements and minerals from entering your water and eventually, your body.\n\nThe following video guide has more in-depth instructions for you to follow concerning your fridge's water filter.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Broken Fridge Door Switch\nOn either side of your refrigerator will be a door switch that either activates or deactivates any cooling or ice/water production when the door is opened. If the switch responsible for that ice and water production is bad or defective, which can be detected by the light properly turning on when the door is opened, it will cause your ice maker to stop working properly. Luckily, we have a wide-range of switches in our PartSelect refrigerator switch inventory, and a general guide to tell you how to replace it:\n\n\nDisconnect your refrigerator from its wall outlet to turn it off.\nUse two flat tools, such as a putty-knife and flat-head screwdriver, to pry the switch out from the interior wall of the freezer.\nUsing a set of pliers, pull the switch out from its housing and disconnect any connected wire harnesses.\nDiscard the switch, or test it with a multimeter for extra assurance.\nConnect the wire harness to the terminals of the new switch.\nPlace the switch back into the door and push it firmly within the housing.\nConnect your refrigerator back to its wall outlet and test the door and ice maker after 10–15 minutes. Note: If your refrigerator has not made ice in a significant amount of time, give it up to 24 hours to produce ice.\n\n\n\nBelow is a general video guide to instruct you on this repair.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve\nSolenoid water inlet valves are used within refrigerators and appliances in general to activate to allow water to flow freely and contain filters to keep out any dirt or debris that could be in your water supply. If a water inlet valve is bad or becomes clogged and needs replacement, it will cause the water or ice dispenser in your refrigerator to have a weak level of pressure and not dispense or produce water and ice. However, you can find the OEM water inlet valve for your refrigerator model in our PartSelect inventory, and use the following general guide to remove and replace it:\n\n\nTurn off and disconnect your fridge from its water and power supply.\nLocate the inlet valve and remove any panels that may be securing it.\nUnthread any securing screws holding the valve in place, and pull the valve out.\nRemove any wire harnesses connected to the valve, and document their original position for future reinstallation.\nRemove each of the tubes connected to the valve, ensuring you have a towel handy in case water is still within any of the tubes.\nOnce the old solenoid water inlet valve is removed and discarded, cut a quarter-inch off each tube before installing the new valve with the tubes and wire harnesses.\nWith each tube and wire secured, install the new valve within the refrigerator, ensuring it's properly mounted and secure, and all screws are properly threaded.\nReassemble any cover panels for the rear of the refrigerator, and connect the water line first, before the power line.\nTurn the refrigerator on and allow the fridge a few hours to calibrate before testing the water or ice maker, monitoring it for any leaks.\n\n\n\nThe following is a general video guide to instruct you on this repair.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Fix a Broken Fridge Ice Dispenser Actuator\nIf your ice maker is producing ice but the ice is not dispensing, it is certainly an issue with its dispenser actuator, also known as a paddle. This actuator is what you push your cup against to activate the ice maker and dispense ice. If you need to replace yours, we have whatever OEM part you need within our PartSelect fridge dispenser inventory, and a general guide to show you how to replace it:\n\n\nUnplug your fridge to disconnect it from power.\nUse a screwdriver to remove any screws securing the user interface cover.\nDisconnect and remove the user interface panel and any wire harnesses.\nUnthread and remove any further screws securing the dispenser assembly.\nUnscrew the dispenser/actuator actuator and remove it, before replacing it with the new actuator.\nScrew the new actuator in and ensure it's properly secured within the dispenser mechanism and any tension springs.\nPlace the dispenser into its original position, and connect all necessary wire harnesses.\nConnect the user interface panel and any further wire harnesses, as well as its cover.\nPlug your fridge into the wall outlet to connect it to power.\nTurn on your fridge and test the dispenser.\n\n\n\nThe following is a video guide to provide general instruction for this repair.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nWhy is My Ice Maker is Still Not Working?\nIf after reaching this point, your fridge's ice maker is still not working, you may have an issue with the refrigerator's control board, which may require a more dedicated repair.\n\nFor our other fun and informative PartSelect content, check out our home improvement and appliance error code blog articles!

However, there may be several other reasons, such as a faulty door switch or diode, or damaged shelf supports that can also contribute to the problem. Understanding the causes behind these electrical sparks and learning how to troubleshoot them is essential for both the longevity of your microwave and the safety of your kitchen. In this article, we will delve into the various factors that can lead to sparking in microwaves. Moreover, we will provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide on resolving each of these issues, empowering you to address the sparks and restore your microwave to optimal functionality. \n\nMetal Inside the Microwave\nMetal reflects microwaves and creates a concentrated area where electrical currents form. The concentrated energy can lead to sparking, or arcing. The presence of metal inside the microwave cavity can result in electrocution, or even a fire inside the microwave by igniting flammable materials inside the appliance. Metal can also reflect microwaves back into the magnetron - a critical part of the voltage circuitry - and damage this component, leading to a major malfunction or complete failure of the appliance. If you notice sparking inside the microwave as it is in use, stop the microwave immediately and check for the presence of metal inside the appliance.  \n\nCommon Metal Items that Can Cause Sparking: \n\nAluminum Foil: Highly reflective, aluminum foil can cause sparks and should never be used in the microwave.\nMetal Utensils or Containers: Avoid placing metal utensils or containers with metallic accents in the microwave, as they can cause sparks and damage.\nMetal Twist Ties or Staples: Remove metal twist ties from packages or staples from microwaveable food containers before placing them in the microwave.\nMetal Trim on Dishes: Some dishes have metallic trim or decorations. It is recommended to avoid using such dishes in the microwave to prevent sparking.\nMetalized Plastic: Containers with a metalized plastic coating can also cause issues. Always check the packaging to ensure it is microwave-safe.\n\n\n\nChipped Interior Coating\nIf the interior coating in your microwave is chipped or cracked, it can expose the metal underneath, leading to sparking or arcing during operation. The interior coating can be damaged by use of harsh cleaning materials or abrasive scrubbers, improperly placing containers inside the microwave, using the wrong type of containers, or normal aging. \n\nHow to Fix the Chipped Interior Coating to Stop Microwave Sparking or Arcing\n \n\nUnplug the microwave from the power outlet to ensure your safety during the repair process. It is recommended to wear protective gloves and safety glasses to avoid any contact with the interior coating or paint.\nUse isopropyl alcohol to clean the chipped area and the surrounding region and ensure that the surface area is free from any grease, food debris.\nGently sand the chipped area using sandpaper to prepare the surface for the touch-up paint and wipe the area again once you are done. \nUse a small paintbrush to apply the microwave-safe touch-up paint to the chipped area.\nFollow the manufacturer's instructions on the paint can for drying times.\nOnce the paint has dried, inspect the repaired area to ensure that it is smooth and well-covered, and use this time to make any additional touch-ups if necessary.\nPlug the microwave back in and use it as usual to ensure that the repaired area does not exhibit sparking or arcing. Do not run an empty microwave.\n\n\n\nDamaged Waveguide Cover \nA waveguide cover is designed to protect the opening in the microwave's cavity where microwaves enter from the magnetron. The waveguide directs these microwaves into the cooking area of the oven. The cover also prevents food particles, grease, and moisture from entering the opening and reaching the sensitive electronic components inside the microwave.\nWhen a waveguide cover is damaged, the metal plate underneath it may become exposed, or food and debris may reach the electronic components behind the cover, resulting in sparking or arcing within the microwave. \n\nHow to Replace a Damaged Waveguide Cover to Fix Microwave Sparking or Arcing\n\n\nUnplug the microwave from the power source to ensure safety during the replacement process. Wear safety equipment, such as gloves and safety glasses, to protect yourself from sharp edges.\nThe waveguide cover is often located on the interior of the microwave, usually on the right-hand side or the top. You can refer to your microwave's user manual for specific instructions on locating the cover.\nUse a screwdriver to remove any screws securing the waveguide cover in place. Keep track of the screws for reassembly. Gently pull the old waveguide cover away from the microwave.\nTake the opportunity to clean the interior of the microwave using a mild soap and water solution or a mild cleaning solution. Wipe away any food residue or grease. \nAlign the new waveguide cover in the same position as the old one. Secure the new cover in place using the screws removed earlier. Ensure a snug fit.\nPerform a visual inspection to make sure the waveguide cover is securely in place. Confirm that there are no gaps or misalignments that could allow food particles to enter the microwave's internal components.\nPlug the microwave back into the power source. Test the microwave to ensure that it operates as expected with the new waveguide cover in place.\n\n\n\nDamaged Wall Shelf Supports\nIt is common for the paint on the supports on the interior wall shelves/racks in your microwave to chip over time. This causes the metal inside to become exposed resulting in the creation of a point of electrical discharge, leading to sparking. You can paint over the chips using the steps listed above to resolve the issue. However, if the supports are bent, cracked, dented or damaged in anyway, you will likely need to replace the shelf supports to resolve the sparking issue. \n\nHow to Replace Damaged Wall Shelf Supports to Fix Microwave Sparking or Arcing \n\n\nUnplug the microwave from the power source before you begin the repair. \nOpen the microwave door to access the interior, and carefully pull out the shelf/rack.\nIdentify the damaged wall support(s) within the microwave, and either twist it off or use a putty knife to detach it. \nWipe down the interior of the microwave to remove any food residue or grease.\nInstall the new support and ensure that it is securely fitted to prevent movement during use.\nReturn the shelf to the microwave and your repair is complete!\n\n\n\nFaulty Door Switch\nThe door switch in a microwave is a safety feature designed to ensure that the microwave operates only when the door is securely closed. If the door switched is damaged or its contacts are corroded or worn out then, it can potentially lead to sparking or arcing. If the door switch is faulty, you will also likely notice a burning smell coming from the microwave. Follow the instructions below to safely replace the door switch. \n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Door Switch to Fix Microwave Sparking or Arcing\n\n\nUnplug the microwave from the power source. Wear safety equipment, such as gloves and safety glasses, to protect yourself from potential electrical hazards.\nRemove the outer cover or panel to access the control panel area.\nIdentify the door switch assembly, usually located near the latch mechanism on the microwave's body.\nTake note of the wiring connected to the door switch. Use a marker or labels or simply take a picture with your phone for easy reconnection later.\nUse the screwdriver to remove any screws securing the door switch in place and carefully disconnect the wires from the old door switch.\nRemove the old door switch from the appliance and set it aside.\nPosition the new door switch inside the microwave and connect the wires to the corresponding terminals before securing the new door switch in place using the screws.\nPut the control panel and outer cover back in place and reattach any screws that were removed during disassembly.\nPlug the microwave back into the power source and test it to ensure that the new door switch is functioning correctly.\n\n\n\nFaulty Diode\nThe diode in your microwave is a part of the high-voltage circuitry that directs the current from the power source to the magnetron, which is responsible for generating microwaves that heat the food. If a diode in the microwave's high-voltage circuitry becomes faulty or fails, it can lead to sparking or arcing due to short circuits, overheating, or voltage spikes. If you are attempting to\nreplace the diode in your microwave, it is important to follow the safety precautions below to avoid electrocution and ensure your safety. \n\nHow to Discharge the Microwave Capacitor\nRemoving voltage from a microwave before working on it is crucial for safety as a microwave carries the risk of serious electrical shock, even when it is unplugged. The high voltage components should be treated with care and precautions should be taken to ensure a safe working environment.\n\n\nDisconnect the microwave from the power source by unplugging it. This is the most effective way to ensure that no power is reaching the appliance.\nWait for at least 30 minutes to allow the capacitor to discharge. Even after unplugging, microwaves may still hold a charge in the high-voltage capacitor, which can be dangerous. \nPlace a well insulated screwdriver blade or needle-nose pliers across each set of capacitor terminals to facilitate the safe discharge of any remaining voltage. Hold it there for a few seconds. Be aware that this process often creates a loud popping sound. \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Diode to Fix Microwave Sparking or Arcing\n\n\nRemove the microwave turntable and shelf from the cavity.\nRemove the outer cover of the microwave.\nOnce you have access to the internal components, locate the faulty diode. The diode is typically connected to the capacitor and magnetron.\nTake note of the orientation of the diode. It is essential to place the new diode in the correct position.\nUse the soldering iron to melt the solder joints connecting the faulty diode to the circuit board. Carefully remove the diode.\nPlace the new diode in the same orientation as the faulty one. Solder the new diode into place, making sure the solder joints are secure and not bridged.\nUse wire cutters to trim any excess leads from the diode.\nInspect your soldering work to ensure there are no cold solder joints or solder bridges. Reassemble the microwave and plug it in. Test the microwave to ensure that it is functioning properly.\nOnce you've confirmed that the microwave is working correctly, replace the outer cover.\n\n\n\nHow to Use and Take Care of Your Microwave \n\n\nUse Microwave-Safe Containers: Always use containers and utensils labeled as microwave-safe to avoid sparks and potential damage. Microwaving food in containers not labeled as microwave-safe can result in extreme temperatures and pressure, leading to damage or chipping of the interior coating over time. \nRegular Cleaning: Food particles or grease tend to build-up on the interior surfaces of the microwave over time. This accumulation can create hot spots that may result in sparking. Therefore, it is important to regularly clean your microwave to keep it in optimal condition for longer. \nBe Gentle During Cleaning: When cleaning, ensure that you use mild, non-abrasive cleaning materials and avoid harsh scrubbing to maintain the integrity of the interior coating.\nAvoid Metal in the Microwave: Remember to never place metal objects, containers with metallic accents, or aluminum foil inside the microwave.\nHandle with Care: Avoid dropping heavy or hard objects inside the microwave, and handle cookware carefully to prevent impact damage. \nRegular Inspection: Periodically inspect the interior of the microwave for any signs of wear, damage, or chipping. The sooner you can resolve minor issues, the less likely they will become major issue in the future. \n\n\n\nUnderstanding the causes of sparking or arcing in a microwave is crucial for ensuring the safety and longevity of your appliance.

When this happens, you might hear the oven beep, or you may notice that it is overheating or isn't getting as hot as you set it. This issue usually happens because of two main parts: the temperature sensor or the main control board. In rarer cases, it could result from insufficient ventilation or if the oven door is obstructed or not fully closed.\n\nWhat Causes the F10 Error on a Kenmore Oven?\nThe F10 error is your oven's way of saying it's sensing temperatures outside its safe operating range, often known as a 'runaway temperature.' It might also mean that the oven is struggling to maintain and monitor its heat properly.\n\n\nWear and Tear: With regular use, the components of any appliance will naturally degrade. As the oven ages, it might not function as efficiently as it once did.\nFaulty Wiring or Loose Connections: Wires in the oven connect different parts, helping them communicate. If these wires have issues or aren’t connected tightly, the temperature sensor cannot “talk” to the main control board properly.\nFaulty Components: If the temperature sensor or control board is defective due to manufacturing issues or unexpected failures, the oven may misread or poorly control the temperature.\nPower Surges: A power surge is a brief spike in electrical voltage. It can be caused by lightning strikes, power outages, or large appliances cycling on and off. A sudden surge of electricity can potentially damage the sensitive electronics within the oven.\n\n\nWhat Signs Should You Watch Out For with the F10 Error on a Kenmore Oven?\nThese are the symptoms that could signal trouble brewing in your Kenmore oven: \n\nBeeping: This is an alarm meant to grab your attention because something is not right with the oven’s temperature, making it a potential safety hazard. This error may even be triggered when the oven is shut off or is cooled at room temperature.\nOverheating: If your oven gets hotter than the temperature you set, it can result in burnt and overcooked food.\nNot Heating to the Set Temperature: On the other hand, if your oven doesn’t get as hot as you’ve set it to, it can lead to undercooked or unevenly cooked food. It's important to be mindful of this, especially when preparing dishes that require precise temperatures for safety reasons.\nTemperature Fluctuations: The oven's temperature may go up and down erratically or it may not stay stable.\n\n\nHow to Fix an F10 Error on a Kenmore Oven\nBefore diving into a deep fix, try a simple reset for your oven. Sometimes, it's all you need to clear minor glitches. Here’s how you can do it:\n\nStart by hitting the \"OFF\" or \"CANCEL\" button on your oven's control panel.\nUnplug your oven from the wall. If your oven is directly wired to your home, go to your home's electrical panel and flip the specific circuit breaker for the oven to the \"off\" position.\nLet the oven sit without power for a minute or two.\nPlug your oven back in or turn the circuit breaker back to the \"on\" position.\nSwitch your oven back on using its control panel.\n\n\nKeep the area around your oven free from any objects or clutter that might block the airflow. This allows the oven to release heat effectively. Additionally, always make sure that the oven door is completely closed during operation, without any obstructions. Even a small gap or something blocking the door can cause temperature inconsistencies.\n\nIf the error's still staring back at you, the oven might have deeper issues, possibly with its temperature sensor or control board.\n\nRemember to disconnect the oven for safety before poking around in your oven. If your oven is electric, it often has two safety switches (called fuses or breakers). Make sure both are turned off. If they're connected by a clip and you turn one off, the other should turn off too.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Temperature Sensor on a Kenmore Oven\nAn oven's temperature sensor is like a thermometer inside the oven that checks if the temperature matches what you set it to. It typically looks like a thin, elongated probe sticking out from the oven's rear wall.\nIf the sensor is defective, it might send incorrect temperature readings to the control board. The oven may think it's overheating or not heating enough, even if it is only at room temperature.\n\nHow to Access and Test the Temperature Sensor on a Kenmore Oven\nHave your owner's manual handy for model-specific instructions. If needed, remove the oven door to make space while working on the sensor.\n\nRemove the oven racks to access the back wall of the oven.\nFind the temperature sensor probe using your owner's manual as a guide.\nUse a nut driver to remove the screws securing the base of the probe. \nGently pull the temperature sensor probe a few inches into the oven, and use needle-nose pliers to guide the wire harness connector through the hole in the oven wall.\nWhile holding the wire connector with needle-nose pliers, press the locking tab to disconnect it from the sensor probe. Be careful not to let the connector slip back through the hole; otherwise, you'll need to remove the oven's back panel to retrieve it.\nSeparate the wire plug from the wire connector.\n\n\nTo test the sensor, you'll need a multimeter. Set the multimeter to measure resistance (ohms) and put one of its leads on each of the two wire terminals of the temperature sensor.\nWhen the room temperature is roughly 70°F (or about 21°C), the sensor should show a resistance reading close to 1,080 ohms. If the multimeter gives you a reading that is not within the range of 1,075 to 1,085 ohms, you should consider replacing it.\n\nHow to Replace the Temperature Sensor on a Kenmore Oven\nOnce you have your new temperature sensor, installing it in your oven is easier than you think:\n\nUse a pair of needle-nose pliers to hold the connector and snap it securely into the plug of the new temperature sensor.\nGuide the wire back into the rear wall of the oven.\nPlace the new sensor probe in position and make sure to align the holes for the mounting screws.\nInsert the mounting screws and use a nut driver to tighten them securely.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Electronic Control Board on a Kenmore Oven\nThe control board manages and regulates the oven’s various functions based on input from sensors and user commands. It often appears as a circuit board with various components, situated behind the oven's front panel or at the back. When a control board in your oven has contacts that are stuck or welded together due to a fault, the oven will have problems understanding or reading the temperature correctly.\n\nHow to Access and Test the Electronic Control Board on a Kenmore Oven\nTo get to your control board, you will need to locate it in the control panel: \n\nRemove the screws securing the back shield of the control panel, and then carefully pull the shield off the range.\nUse a digital camera or your phone to take a picture of the wires connected to the control board. This will help you remember where each wire should go when you connect them to the new oven control board later.\nDisconnect all the wires from the oven control board.\nRemove the mounting screws holding the oven control board in place, and gently pull the control board out from the control panel.\n\n\nPerform a simple visual check of the control board. Look for any signs of component failure or a short circuit, such as charring or blackened spots. Make sure to confirm that all the wire connectors are securely attached and that any related wiring isn't frayed. If you're uncertain whether the control board is the problem, it's best to seek assistance from a professional technician.\n\nHow to Replace the Electronic Control Board on a Kenmore Oven\nIf you are confident that the board is malfunctioning, switch it out with a replacement control board: \n\nIf you've got a new overlay for the control board, start by attaching it to the control board. Make sure it lines up correctly and sticks securely. Otherwise, carefully transfer the overlay from the old control board to the new one.\nConnect all the wires to the new oven control board. You can use the digital image you took earlier as a reference.\nPlace the back shield of the control panel onto the back of the control console. Make sure it fits properly and aligns with the screw holes.\nSecure the back shield in place by using the mounting screws. Tighten them firmly to hold the shield securely.\n\n\nNow that you've tackled the F10 error on your Kenmore oven, why stop there?

However, there’s no need to despair. By the time you get to the end of this guide, you’ll understand the key differences between 3-prong and 4-prong dryer cords/outlets, and why upgrading yours may be beneficial for you. We will also guide you through the process of converting your 3-prong cord to a 4-prong cord and wiring a 3-prong outlet with 4 wires, to ensure your home stays safe and laundry day runs more smoothly than ever before.\n\nWhat are the Differences Between a 3-Prong Outlet and a 4-Prong Outlet?\nThe primary difference between 3-prong and 4-prong outlets is the grounding system they provide. \n\n3-Prong Outlets:\n\n\nTypically consists of two hot wires (usually black and red) which carry the current from the electrical supply to the appliance and a neutral wire (usually white) which returns the current to the electrical supply. \nDo not include a separate grounding wire. The grounding function is provided through the neutral wire, which is connected to the appliance's metal frame.\n3-prong cords were commonly used in older homes and with older appliances.\n \n\n\n4-Prong Outlets:\n\n\nConsists of two hot wires (black and red), a neutral wire (white), and an additional ground wire (green or bare copper).\nThe separate ground wire provides a path for fault current to be safely discharged ensuring electrical safety and reducing the risk of electrical shock or fires.\n4-prong cords have become the modern standard for many high-power appliances, such as electric ranges and dryers, to comply with updated electrical codes and safety regulations.\n\n\n\nWhy Switch from a 3-Prong to a 4-Prong Outlet?\n\n\nGrounding: The primary reason for the change is improved grounding. In a 3-prong outlet, the neutral wire and ground wire are grouped. This is risky because if there is an electrical fault, a current could travel up the wire to the dryer resulting in shock. However, 4-prong outlets have an additional wire, specifically for grounding. This provides an additional path for electrical current to safely disperse in the event of a short circuit or equipment failure. Grounding helps protect against electrical shocks, fires, and electrical damage.\nCompliance with Electrical Codes: Many countries, including the United States, have updated their electrical codes to require 4-prong outlets for newer constructions or when replacing old outlets. \nPower Requirements: Many newer appliances require 4-prong outlets, especially those with high power demands such as electric dryers. Electric dryers require a 240-volt supply, which 3-prong outlets are unable to provide. You may notice that you need to run your dryer multiple times for all your clothes to dry. Additionally, if you have older 3-prong outlets in your home and you buy a new appliance, you will likely need to replace the outlet or resort to using an adapter - so you might as well get ahead of the issue now!\n\n\n\nWhat Should You Do if Your Appliance Requires a 4-Prong Outlet?\nIf your appliance requires a 4-prong outlet and your electrical supply has a 3-prong outlet, you have a few options:\n\nInstall a New 4-Prong Outlet: The best solution is to have a qualified electrician install a new 4-prong outlet. This will ensure that your appliance is properly grounded, and will meet current electrical codes and safety standards. \nChange the Appliance Cord: Some appliances come with a cord that can be removed and replaced. You can replace the 3-prong cord with a 4-prong cord yourself. This is usually a straightforward process and maybe the easiest solution if your appliance allows cord replacement. \nUse An Adapter:If replacing the cord or outlet is not an option, you can use an adapter that connects to the existing 3-prong outlet and provides a 4-prong connection for your appliance. However, this should be considered a temporary or last-resort solution.\nThe reason is that the grounding system of a 3-prong outlet is different from that of a 4-prong outlet, and using an adapter doesn't provide the same level of safety as a properly installed 4-prong outlet.\n\n\n\nHow to Change a 3-Prong Cord to a 4-Prong Cord\n\n\nUnplug your appliance from the current outlet or turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to it.\nTypically the cord is attached to a terminal block on the back or underside of the appliance. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws that secure the terminal cover. \nOnce the cover is removed, you will see three wires connected to the terminal block: black (hot), white (neutral), and green or bare (ground). The green or bare wire may be connected to a grounding screw or a metal frame within the appliance. \nCarefully unscrew or detach the wires from the terminal block. If you need to replace any wires, you can use our model search feature to find new wire plugs and connectors for your dryer.\nStrip the insulation from the ends of the three wires on the new 4-prong cord to expose about 1 inch of wire. \nIf your new cord has a green wire (for grounding), attach it to the grounding screw or metal frame where the green or bare wire from the old cord was connected. \nConnect the three wires from the new cord to the corresponding terminals on the terminal block: black (hot) to the brass or black terminal; white (neutral) to the silver or white terminal; green (ground) to the green or green terminal. \nUse a strain relief connector or wire nuts to secure the cord in place to prevent it from getting pulled out of the terminal block.\nReplace the terminal cover and secure it with the screws you removed earlier. \nPlug the new 4-prong cord into the corresponding outlet, and turn on the power. Test your appliance to ensure it's working correctly. \nIf you used a strain relief connector, make sure it's properly installed and secured to the appliance to prevent the cord from being accidentally pulled out. It is recommended to also use electrical tape to secure any loose wires or connections\n\n\n\nIn a world where electrical appliances play an important role in our daily lives, understanding the difference between 3 and 4-prong outlets and knowing how to make the change will help you prioritize the safety of your home and the reliability of your appliances. It is important to ensure that you have a properly grounded 4-prong outlet for appliances that require it, such as your dryer. This reduces the risk of electrical shock and fires and also aligns with modern electrical codes and standards. If you're uncomfortable with electrical work or unsure about any part of the process, it's best to consult a qualified electrician to ensure the job is done safely and according to local electrical codes. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Does it seemingly have no power or lights after working perfectly fine? This is a known problem with some models of GE dishwashers that stems from built-in features or parts that may be worn down, or where the main circuit board and/or touchpad circuit board are bad and must be replaced. Luckily, we're here to help you figure out what's wrong with your dishwasher, so you can get back to relaxing and your dishes can get back to being clean!\n\nWhy Does Your GE Dishwasher Have No Power or Lights?\nYour GE dishwasher can have issues with its power and lights for a few reasons, but it's either a general part that's broken or not working correctly, or an issue with your dishwasher's control board or user-interface panel. Some of these parts may be easier to work with than others, but the entire repair process is actually quite simple, and you can do it with only a few tools!\n\nGE Dishwasher Has No Power or Lights - What First?\nFirst, it's important to double check the easier things first, before you start disassembling your dishwasher and replacing a part that was never broken to begin with. That said, start with the following items before moving on:\n\n\nCheck Door Latch: The door latch on some GE dishwashers can wear down over extended periods of time, which can lead it not working properly and resulting in your dishwasher not starting. To check your dishwasher's door latch, open the door and try to close it - if it doesn't latch properly, it will need replacing.\nDisable Child-Lock: Certain GE dishwasher models have a child-lock feature, which prevents the dishwasher from turning on or starting while engaged. This feature can be deactivated, but the process is unique to each model, so you will need to refer to your user manual to deactivate it. Once the child lock is disabled, your dishwasher will power on and light up as normal.\n\n\n\nGE Dishwasher Power Issues\nThe main issue with your GE dishwasher's power is probably related to how it manages power. This involves the wall outlet, power supply, control board, and user-interface panel. Each of these components affects the dishwasher's performance, with some being more significant than others. Don't worry, we're here to guide you on what needs fixing and how to do it!\n\nCheck Your Wall Outlet\nIt's important to make sure the wall outlet that's delivering power to your GE dishwasher is compatible and safe. That's why using a tool like a non-contact voltage tester is important, to ensure the current of the electricity coming out of the outlet for your dishwasher is sufficient. If the voltage is too low, consider using another wall outlet to supply its power.\nChecking the fit of the outlet is also important, because often our appliances that stay in the same place can slip out of their wall outlet. If you notice the outlet causes the dishwasher's plug to slip out easily, consider replacing it with the proper safety equipment required.\n\nGE Dishwasher No Power or Lights\nIf your GE dishwasher shows no signs of power and its lights do not activate, there is definitely something wrong between the control board and the user-interface panel - both of which can be diagnosed and replaced if necessary. The following guides will show you how to diagnose this issue so you can replace the appropriate part.\n\nHow to Diagnose Your GE Dishwasher\n\n\nMake sure you have power to the dishwasher and it is plugged into the wall outlet.\nUse a screwdriver or wrench to remove the kick-plate at the front of your dishwasher.\nUse a multimeter to test the terminals to the power supply - if it reads approximately 120 volts, your dishwasher is fine. If not, there is likely an issue with your fuse box and home electricity.\nTo be safe, turn your circuit breaker off or unplug your dishwasher momentarily while handling sensitive electrical equipment.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread the screws holding the control panel.\nDisengage the wire harness attaching to the control panel.\nOpen the control panel and locate the 5 pins on the far left side of the circuit board, facing you.\nUse your multimeter and touch one probe to the 2nd pin and the 5th pin from the left.\nIf your multimeter reads on or around 14 volts, the issue will lie with the user-interface panel. However, if it does not, the control board will need replacing.\n\n\n\nHow to Fix Your GE Dishwasher Control Board\nIf you've tested your control board and it does not read on or around 14 volts, it needs replacing immediately, to get your dishwasher back to normal and get your dishes clean again! Luckily, we have a huge inventory of  GE dishwasher control and circuit boards, and the guide you need to find out how to replace it:\n\n\n\nFollow the steps above to access your control board housing.\nDisconnect any wire harnesses connected to the circuit board and unthread any screws securing it.\nRemove the circuit board from its housing and install the new one.\nSecure the new circuit board by threading any screws and plugging in the appropriate wire harnesses.\nReseat the control circuit board back into position and thread the securing screws for it.\nIf you want to test the dishwasher, you can plug it back in to the wall outlet or restore power.\nWith the dishwasher plugged in and power restored, reinstall the kick-plate and test the dishwasher fully.\n\n\n\nHow to Fix Your GE Dishwasher Touchpad\nIf your GE dishwasher has no lights when powered on, but does have power or if the main circuit board carries 14 volts, the issue is most likely a bad user-interface panel and touchpad. These panels are replaceable and can be interchanged, but will require time and tools to do so.\n\nThankfully, we have an abundance of GE dishwasher touchpads, as well as GE dishwasher panels (if necessary), all within our PartSelect inventory, and the following guide to give you a general overview of how to replace them:\n\n\n\nDisconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet.\nRemove the kick-plate at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nLocate the wire harness connecting to the control board underneath your dishwasher, and disconnect it.\nLocate and unthread any securing screws at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nLift up on the door and carefully remove it from the body of the dishwasher.\nUnthread and remove the screws at the bottom and inside portion of the door.\nSimultaneously lift up on the inside portion and push down on the handle of the dishwasher door to separate it.\nLocate the user-interface circuit board and touch pad, and unthread it to remove it.\nIf you want to, you can test the circuit for continuity with a multimeter.\nSeparate the circuit board from the housing, which may require a flat-head screwdriver or thin metal pick.\nGround yourself to a nearby metal surface, before touching the circuit.\nReplace the circuit in the user-interface panel housing.\nDepending on your model, you may need to change the personality settings of the interface, so refer to the guide of the new circuit.\nIf your user-interface panel needs replacing, use a screwdriver and/or flat tool to remove the old one and replace it.\nReassemble the user-interface circuit board housing and install it.\nReassemble the dishwasher door, securing both halves together and rethreading the screws in.\nSeat the door back onto its hinges, and feed the wire harness down towards the control board at the bottom to plug it in.\nRethread any more securing screws underneath the door and install the kick-plate.\nPlug your dishwasher back in to the wall outlet, and use your dishwasher like normal.\n\n\n\nGE Dishwasher Still Has No Power or Lights\nIf you've reached this point, hopefully your dishwasher is back to running as normal! However, if after replacing both or either the main circuit board and user-interface your GE dishwasher does not power on or light up, there is likely a power supply issue either in the dishwasher itself or within your home - both of which unfortunately will likely require the service of a professional technician.\n\nIf you need any other repair resources, our PartSelect Repair Center is filled with tutorials and videos to help you troubleshoot and diagnose whatever issue you may be having with your dishwasher - or other appliances!

Although your model may have different features or settings, resetting a GE dishwasher can be done by a reset button, powering it on and off, or by putting it into service mode.\n\n\n\nPress Reset Button: Many models of GE dishwashers come with a built-in reset feature, to easily reset it if not functioning properly.\nDisconnect Power to Dishwasher: Often a power reset like disconnecting and reconnecting the power from your breaker for 5 minutes can help to fix any issues you're having with your appliance.\nKick Plate Reset Button or Switch: Some GE dishwasher models feature a reset switch or button behind the kick plate at the bottom of the appliance, which can be used to reset the system.\nService Mode: With certain GE dishwasher models, there are features to enter a 'Service Mode' for a technician to diagnose a problematic part; this mode can also be used to reset the dishwasher.\n\n\n\nWhy Do I Need to Reset My GE Dishwasher?\nIf you're experiencing issues with the power in your home, or if your dishwasher has a history of issues – part or software – resetting can often be the only option you have to restore functionality. Your dishwasher may also be stuck on a washing cycle and the only way to stop it is by disconnecting and reconnecting its power or pushing that reset button on the touchpad.\n\nHow Do You Reset a GE Dishwasher?\nSome of these methods are not only easier but more accessible to most GE dishwasher models, so make sure to check your user manual for every available option:\n\nGE Dishwasher Reset Button\nMost modern GE dishwasher models will come with a built-in reset button or feature for you as the user to press whenever necessary. However, this feature can sometimes only be as useful if you have the user manual for your dishwasher, so ensure you have that handy.\n\nDisconnect and Reconnect Power to GE Dishwasher\nDepending on your setup at home, turning off power to your dishwasher and restoring it soon after by way of the circuit breaker can prove to be the most efficient way to reset it; although you may prefer unplugging and replugging it. Either way, disconnecting its power source can sometimes reset the circuit board and system as a whole and fix any issues you were previously having.\n\nGE Dishwasher Kick Plate Reset Switch or Button\nThis varies from model to model, once again, but your model may have a reset switch for the motor and/or system as a whole underneath and behind a kick plate at the bottom of the dishwasher. This kick plate can be easily removed by unthreading a number of screws with a wrench or screwdriver, locating the switch or button, and activating it. Just make sure the power is connected when you reset it with this method!\n\nEnabling Service Mode on Your GE Dishwasher\nService mode, also known as diagnostic or test mode, can prove to be a useful feature with a variety of GE dishwasher models. Service mode can either be used to diagnose the parts within the dishwasher, like the pump, heating element, or detergent dispenser, or it can be used to reset the dishwasher as a whole. If you discover any parts that are broken or not working properly, check out our PartSelect GE dishwasher inventory. Your GE dishwasher may operate differently, but the following guide is a general idea of how to enter service mode and reset it:\n\n\n\nHold 'Start' and 'Select Cycle' for 5 seconds until the touchpad lights up.\nHold 'Select Cycle' for another 5 seconds. The 'Lock Controls' light may or may not light up. At this point, your dishwasher is now in Service Mode if a light is blinking.\nIf you don't see any blinking lights, hold 'Select Cycle' for another 5 seconds and let go once the blinking begins.\nIn service mode, you can diagnose each part of the dishwasher that corresponds to the light blinks in your user manual. Press 'Select Cycle' to cycle through each part, and the light should blinking a different number each time.\nTo begin resetting the dishwasher, hold the 'Start' button for 5 seconds until its button lights up.\nOnce again hold the 'Select Cycle' and 'Start' button for 5 seconds.\nAfter 5 seconds the touchpad should light up to indicate it's reset, and you can resume using your GE dishwasher as normal.\n\n\n\nGE Dishwasher is Reset But Still Not Working\nIs your GE dishwasher still not working, despite being reset with one of the previously mentioned methods? Or are you having issues with your GE dishwasher where it no longer powers up or responds to any inputs at all? If so, it may be a more deep-rooted issue involving the control board of your dishwasher. Luckily, we have an entire GE dishwasher no power or lights guide on not only what your options are, but how to fix your GE dishwasher to get it back to normal working condition as soon as possible!\n\nFor all other error/fault code articles, stay tuned to our PartSelect blog where you can also find helpful and informative guides for every section of your home.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

When it comes to hoses, inlet hoses supply fresh water to your washing machine for washing clothes, while the drain hose removes used water from the tub and directs it to the drainage system for disposal. Can you use the ones from your old machine, or is it a trip to the store again?\n\nLet's get all of your hose-related questions answered right away so you can find the perfect fit for your machine.\n\nWhat Do Washing Machine Hoses Do?\nThe hoses work together to bring in fresh, clean water and efficiently remove the used, soiled water, so that your washing machine functions effectively.\nWhat Does the Inlet Hose Do on Your Washer?\nInlet hoses supply fresh water to the washing machine so that the tub fills up to wash your clothes. These hoses connect your washing machine to the water taps or valves. You can find them attached at the back of your washing machine. Take a look at the illustration below for a clearer visual:\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhat Does the Drain Hose Do on Your Washer?\nOnce your laundry is cleaned, the drain hose guides the wastewater out of the machine and into the drainage system or a designated disposal area. It extends from the machine and connects to a standpipe, drain, or tub. To get a better idea of how it all fits together, refer to the illustration below:\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nAre Washing Machines Hoses Universal?\nIn short, yes, but there are some important details to consider. While the industry follows certain standardized features, it's not entirely a \"one-size-fits-all\" scenario. Washing machine hoses can vary in terms of length, shape, and material. Some hoses have straight ends, while others have a 90-degree elbow on one end so that the hose fits snugly against your laundry room wall. But they have one thing in common: they all sport ¾-inch female threaded fittings on both ends.\n\nHere's what you'll typically find with most washing machine hoses:\n\nFemale Threaded Ends\nThese are the same type of female fittings or couplings you find on garden hoses, making it simple to connect the hose to a wide range of washing machines without needing special tools or adapters.\n\n¾-Inch Fittings\n Most washing machines and home water connections in the U.S. use this size, ensuring compatibility. This fitting size also allows for a higher water flow capacity and better water pressure compared to smaller fittings.\n\nRed and Blue Markings\nThese are color codes to distinguish between hot and cold water connections for inlet hoses. Red is for hot, and blue is for cold. This way, you can quickly figure out which hose goes where to avoid any mix-ups.\n\nHowever, there are several important factors to keep in mind:\n\nHose Length\nHoses come in various lengths, from short ones of 4 feet to longer ones stretching up to 12 feet. The best length for you depends on how far your washer is from the water taps. You'll want a hose length that comfortably reaches your washer from the taps without being pulled tight or too long to avoid tangling.\n\nMaterial\nWhen it comes to the material of washing machine hoses, three types stand out: plastic, rubber, and stainless steel.\n\nPlastic Hoses\nSome drain hoses are made from corrugated plastic or PVC. These hoses tend to be more flexible than rubber ones, making them suitable for navigating tight or curved spaces. However, they might not offer the same durability, especially when exposed to extreme temperatures or conditions.\n\nRubber Hoses\nRubber washer hoses are made primarily of synthetic rubber, known for their flexibility, making them easy to maneuver during installation. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off. Rubber hoses don't last as long as their stainless steel counterparts. Over time, they might show signs of wear like kinks, bulges, or other weak spots, which can potentially lead to unfortunate leaks. Additionally, rubber hoses can suffer damage due to minerals present in the water or from exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nBraided Stainless Steel Hoses\nOn the other hand, braided stainless steel hoses combine the flexibility of rubber with an added layer of protection. These hoses are essentially rubber hoses reinforced with a woven stainless steel outer layer. This protective layer ensures that the hose can withstand even high-pressure conditions without easily bursting. It's worth noting that the steel's corrosion-resistant nature means these hoses are more resilient against water quality issues or any chemicals found in the water. That's why they're a popular choice for inlet hoses.\n\nAuto Shut-off Features\nSome washing machine hoses come equipped with auto shut-off valves, a safety feature that kicks in to stop the water supply to your washing machine in the event of a hose malfunction or failure, minimizing the risk of water damage.\n\nElbows\nSometimes, washing machines are tucked into tight corners or recesses. This is where hoses with 'elbows' come in handy. Instead of a straight connection, these hoses have a bent or elbow design, allowing for a more compact and space-efficient connection between your washing machine and the water taps. They help prevent kinking and reduce strain on the hose connections.\n\nSo when choosing washing machine hoses, you will need to consider various factors. Drain hoses are typically crafted from plastic or PVC due to their need for flexibility and lightness to fit into tight spaces. On the other hand, when it comes to inlet hoses, braided stainless steel options tend to outshine rubber hoses in terms of durability and damage resistance.\n\nTo make the right choice, consider the distance between your machine and the tap when picking the hose length. If leak prevention is a concern, opt for hoses equipped with auto shut-off valves. And if you're dealing with tight spaces, think about using hoses with elbows, but be sure they match your machine's setup for a hassle-free installation.\n\nCan I Reuse a Washing Machine Hose?\nYour washing machine works hard, and so do its hoses. Over time, and depending on how often you use your machine and what your hoses are made of, they'll naturally wear out. It might seem like a good idea to reuse an old hose if it looks okay, but that's taking a chance. Why? Because hoses can weaken and break down due to:\n\n\nWear and Tear: Washing machine hoses move during the machine's cycles, and this constant bending and flexing can lead to wear and tear over time.\nWater Quality: If the water in your area has high mineral content, sediments, or chemicals, it can accelerate hose deterioration, particularly hard water, which leaves deposits in the hose.\nWater Pressure: If there's too much water pressure, it can strain the hose, causing it to stretch out, twist, or even pop. This is especially risky with rubber hoses that are less robust.\nIncorrect Installation: Setting up the hose wrong, like making it too tight or causing it to kink, can put undue stress on the hoses.\n\n\nSo even if an old hose looks fine, it's best not to reuse it. It's safer to get a new one and avoid any unexpected leaks or damages. Remember, it's more cost-effective to purchase a high-quality hose than to deal with the consequences of potential flooding in your home.\n\nHow to Replace Your Washing Machine Hoses\nOnce you’ve your replacement inlet hoses or drain hose, gather your tools, like pliers or vice grips, and keep a towel or bucket close by in case of water spills.\nFor safety, unplug your washing machine. Then, find the valves near the hoses that bring water to your machine, and turn them off by twisting to the right. Now, turn your washing machine around to reach the hoses at the back. With these steps, you're all set to replace your hoses.\n\nHow to Replace the Inlet Hoses on Your Washer\n\nStep One: Find the hoses at the back of your washing machine; they connect to both the machine and the water valves. They're usually color-coded, with red for hot water and blue for cold water.\nStep Two: Use your tool to gently grip the nut or connector on one of the hoses where it connects to the washer. Turn it to the left to loosen it.\nStep Three: Hold the removed hoses over buckets or pans to let any remaining water drain out.\nStep Four: Take the cold water hose (blue) and connect it to the cold water tap. Twist it onto the tap's connector by turning it clockwise to secure it. Repeat this step with the hot water hose (red) and the hot water tap. Be careful not to overtighten and damage the threads.\n\n\nHow to Replace the Drain Hose on Your Washer\nBefore you begin, check your user manual. You might need to remove the back access panel to reach the drain hose connected to the tub, and your user manual will have specific instructions for your machine. Once you've got that covered, follow these steps:\n\nStep One: Locate the drain hose. It's typically a thicker, flexible hose connected to the back of your washing machine, leading to a drain, standpipe, or tub.\nStep Two: Gently pull the hose out from its drain or standpipe. Always support the hose to prevent sudden water release.\nStep Three: The drain hose is usually held onto the machine's outlet with a clamp or connector. If it's a spring clamp, squeeze it with pliers and slide it up the hose. If it's a screw-type clamp, loosen the screw until you can slide the hose off.\nStep Four: Carefully wiggle and pull the drain hose off the washing machine's outlet. If it's snug, take your time and use gentle force to avoid damaging the outlet.\nStep Five: Hold the removed drain hose over your bucket or pan to let any trapped water drain out.\nStep Six: Before attaching the new hose, slide the clamp around the elbow to allow the connector to fit onto the outlet on the back of the washer. Ensure the hose is fully inserted onto the outlet. Slide the clamp into position, making sure it sits between the two ridges on the elbow.\nStep Seven: When installing the outlet of the drain hose into your standpipe, make sure not to insert it too tightly. It's important not to block any airflow around the hose to prevent a siphoning effect. Keep the preformed bend of the hose in place.\nStep Eight: The drain hose may come with a zip tie. Use it to attach the hose to the side of the standpipe or any suitable nearby spot. Now you've successfully replaced your drain hose while following the necessary precautions from your user manual.\n\n\nWhen Should I Replace a Washing Machine Hose?\nIt’s smart to replace those hoses every 3-5 years, but in between, they need a bit of TLC too. Here are a few tips to keep the in tip-top shape:\n\nRegular Checks: Give your hoses a once-over now and then. This means checking for obvious signs like bulges or cracks, but also feeling around for any unexpected dampness or spotting any telltale water stains or puddles nearby.\nKeep Track of Hose Age: If you're scratching your head trying to recall when you last changed yours, it might be a sign to get new ones.\nEnsure a Tight Connection: A little wiggle here and there might not seem like much, but make sure those hoses and inlets are snugly connected to your water source. Loose connections could lead to unwanted leaks.\nGive Them a Break: Not using your washing machine? It's a good habit to turn off the water supply. This little act can decrease the pressure on those hoses, giving them a longer, stress-free life.\n\n\nWhile many washing machine hoses seem universally adaptable at first glance, some nuances can make or break your laundry setup. Paying a bit of attention to details like hose type and extra features can save you a whole lot of waterlogged headaches down the line.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

But if it's not heating or even starting, a small part named the 'thermal fuse' might be to blame. Designed to prevent overheating, the thermal fuse shuts off your dryer when it becomes excessively hot. So, what is this thermal fuse, where is it hiding inside your dryer, and how can you tackle its replacement?\n\nWhat is a Dryer Thermal Fuse?\nMost dryers have a built-in safety feature called a thermal fuse. It is also known as a thermal cutoff or a temperature fuse. This device, usually white or silver in color, looks like a tiny rectangular piece with two wires sticking out from its body. When the dryer gets too hot, the thermal fuse “trips” or \"blows,\" shutting the power to the heating part of the dryer so that it does not overheat. Once a thermal fuse is blown, it can't be reset or reused and must be replaced.\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhere is the Dryer Thermal Fuse?\nRegardless of whether your dryer is electric or gas-powered, you'll usually find the thermal fuse at the back or bottom of the machine. It's located close to the exhaust duct, near the heating element or burner. Take a look at the illustration below for a clearer picture. For more detailed information specific to your model, it's a smart move to consult your user manual.\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nHow Do I Know if the Dryer Thermal Fuse is Blown?\nWhen a thermal fuse is blown, your dryer will give you some hints:\n\nYour dryer may continue to spin, but it won't heat up. So, even after a full cycle, your clothes remain damp.\nYour dryer might not start up at all, even though it sounds like it's trying to.\n\n\nHow to Test a Dryer Thermal Fuse with a Multimeter\nYou can use a tool called a multimeter to check the fuse:\n\nStep 1: Set the multimeter to the lowest setting of ohms of resistance.\nSaveEmbed Image\nStep 2: Bring the two multimeter probes together. You should see a reading near zero.\nSaveEmbed Image\nStep 3: Place one probe on each terminal of the thermal fuse.\nSaveEmbed Image\nStep 4: If the multimeter doesn't beep or if it displays a reading significantly different from zero (as shown in the image below), then the fuse is likely blown.\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nShould I Bypass the Thermal Fuse To Use a Dryer?\nA word of caution: if someone suggests you \"bypass\" or skip over a blown thermal fuse, please don't! Remember, the fuse is there for your safety by keeping your dryer from getting too hot and causing fires. If it's not working, replace it before you use your dryer again.\n\nHow Do I Prevent the Dryer Thermal Fuse From Blowing?\nIf your dryer's thermal fuse has blown, it's often a sign of another underlying problem. Before you replace the fuse, it's important to figure out and fix the root issue. If you don’t, the new fuse might just trip again soon after you replace it.\n\nThe fuse usually stops working because the exhaust vent is blocked, there's too much lint inside the dryer, or there's an issue with the heating element. Regularly cleaning and checking your dryer can help you avoid these issues.\n\nHow Do I Clean My Lint Trap?\nLocate your dryer's lint trap, which is typically found at the top or front of the machine. Gently pull it out. Brush off any lint you see using your hand. Take a moment to inspect the filter for damage or holes that might allow lint to sneak into the dryer’s exhaust. If the filter seems worn or has any damage, you might want to replace it.\n\nIf the filter appears extra dirty, you can wash it with warm water and mild soap. Let it dry fully before putting it back. Don't forget to give the slot where the lint trap sits a good clean with a brush.\n  \n  \n \n\nHow Do I Clean My Dryer Vent?\nUnplug your dryer and gently move it away from the wall so you can see its back. It's a good idea to wear safety glasses and maybe even a mask as some lint may fly around.\n\nCleaning Inside of the Dryer\nWith the dryer moved forward, you'll notice a hose or vent at the back. Remove this and take a look inside for any lint or other debris buildup.\n\nAlso, peek inside the dryer where the hose was attached. If you notice a lot of lint here, it might be a good idea to open up the dryer and give it a thorough cleaning with a vacuum.\n\nCleaning the Dryer's External Duct\nFor the external ductwork that leads outdoors, you'll want to use a rotary brush (which looks a bit like those brushes you use for water bottles). You can grab one of these from most hardware stores.\n\nHead outside to where the dryer's external vent is. You may need to take off the cover to reach inside with the brush. Some brushes can connect to a vacuum, which sucks up the lint while you brush. If you have one of these, set it up.\n\nPush your brush in and out of the vent. If you're using a drill, make sure it's turning in the same direction the whole time. Gently move the brush back and forth inside the vent to dislodge any lint.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nWhere Can I Buy a Dryer Thermal Fuse?\nNeed a new thermal fuse for your dryer? You're in the right place! Here at PartSelect, we offer genuine replacement thermal fuses. All you need to do is search using your dryer's model number, and we'll help you find the right one. Once you've got the fuse in hand, let's install it step by step.\n\nHow Do I Replace the Dryer Thermal Fuse?\nTo replace a thermal fuse, you'll need a Phillips-head or a flathead screwdriver, and a pair of needle-nose pliers. First things first, unplug your dryer. Keep your user manual within arm’s reach, just in case you need model-specific instructions.\n\n\nStep 1: Depending on your dryer, use a screwdriver to remove the back panel or the bottom front panel.\nStep 2: Search for the thermal fuse near the blower housing. If you're having a hard time spotting it, your user manual might have a diagram to help.\nStep 3: Unscrew or unclip the faulty fuse and disconnect the wires from the old fuse using needle-nose pliers, making a note or even a quick photo with your phone so you remember where they go.\nStep 4: Hook the wires up to your new fuse, ensuring they're connected the same way as before. Then, put the fuse where the old one was, using the screw or clip to secure it.\nStep 5: Put the panel you removed back in place and plug your dryer in. Before running a full cycle, test your dryer by turning it on for a minute to make sure it warms up.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nAnd there you have it! The ABCs of locating and replacing a dryer's thermal fuse. Even if you've never thought of yourself as the \"handy\" type, with a little patience and care, this is a task you can totally tackle.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This error code may appear if the door wasn’t fully closed, resulting in the fridge not being able to cool properly. If you ran a diagnostic test on your fridge and it displays a 22E or 22C error code, the fan issues may be due to ice buildup or a motor failure. Both of which would prevent the fan from working properly to cool your fridge.\n\nTroubleshooting a Samsung Fridge 22E or 22C Error Code\n\nIf you come home to your fridge door ajar and the 22E fault code being displayed, resolving this is a simple process. You will want to transfer any unspoiled food from the fridge and freezer into a cooler. Unplug the fridge and leave the doors open for a few hours. After that time has passed, close the doors and plug the fridge back in. Your fridge fan should now work correctly, and this method should clear the 22E error code from the fridge display. If unplugging the fridge does not resolve the issue, or the error code comes back again later, you will want to inspect the parts listed below or call for a technician.\n\nHow to Fix Samsung Fridge 22E Fan Issues\n\nIf you have noticed that your fridge isn’t getting cool, or the fan is making noises besides the normal operating sound, there may be other issues with your evaporator fan. Running a diagnostic test and getting the error code 22E or 22C would confirm this.\n\n       \n              The method to run a diagnostic test on your Samsung fridge will vary depending on the model you have.  It will typically involve pressing in two buttons simultaneously, and holding for about 10 seconds until you hear a chime. The display will then flash and the fridge will run its diagnostic. Consult your user manual for the exact buttons to press on your fridge model. Common ones include the top left/top right buttons, power freezer/power cool buttons, or the freezer/fridge buttons.\n       \n\nIf your diagnostic test resulted in a 22E or 22C error code, here is how you can inspect and replace the parts that may be causing the issue. With the fridge unplugged, access the evaporator fan behind the back panel of the freezer compartment. Inspect the fan blades to see if they are damaged or loose.  Then check that the motor shaft turns freely. If the fan doesn’t turn freely, the evaporator fan motor will need to be replaced. Note that if your refrigerator displays an error code of 21E instead of 22E, that is directly related to the fan freezing up. A lack of airflow can cause ice buildup, which would cause the fan to not rotate.\n\nHow to Replace the Evaporator Fan\n\nIf you notice that the evaporator fan is damaged, you will need to replace this part. You can find a new OEM evaporator fan for your Samsung fridge by searching with your model number. The fan sits on the evaporator motor shaft, and you will need to remove the motor assembly from the fridge to replace the fan. Once removed, you should be able to just pull off the damaged fan and push the new one into place.\n\nHow to Replace an Evaporator Fan Motor\n\nThe evaporator fan motor pulls air over the evaporator coils when the compressor is running. This air is then circulated into the fridge to keep your fresh food cool. If your fridge is noisier than normal, the motor may be failing. You’ll also notice that the fridge is warmer than normal, and there will likely be frost buildup on the fan when you inspect it. Installing a new evaporator fan motor is a simple repair. Please note that exact steps may vary based on your model of refrigerator.\n\n\nBefore you begin, you’ll need to clear space in the freezer. Move any items into a cooler while you work, then disconnect the power to your fridge.\n\nThe evaporate fan motor is found behind the panel at the back of the freezer compartment. You may need a screwdriver or a nutdriver in order to remove the panel.\n\nDisconnect the motor assembly wire harness. You may need a pair of pliers for this task.\n\nConnect the new evaporator fan motor by clipping in the wire harness.\n\nYou can then reinstall the back panel in your freezer, add your items back in, and plug in your fridge.\n\n\nHow to Prevent Future Samsung Fridge 22E Error Codes\n\nThe best way to ensure your Samsung fridge doesn’t run into further 22E error codes to making sure the door is fully closed each time. If you overfill the fridge or freezer, something may prevent the doors from closing properly and creating a tight seal. You can also check that the door gasket is in good condition. If the gasket is dirty, it may also be preventing a tight seal, which cleaning would resolve. If the gasket is cracked or damaged, you will likely need to replace it.\n\nHow to Replace a Door Gasket\n\nIf your Samsung fridge door gasket needs to be replaced, begin by removing the damaged gasket. Do this by starting at one corner and pulling the gasket away from the door frame. Inspect the grove the gasket fits into for any dirt or debris, and clean it out. To install a new gasket, again start at a corner and insert the gasket into the channel ensuring it is flush with the fridge door.\n\n \n \n\n\nResolving a Samsung fridge 22E error code is generally as easy as “turn it off and back on again” but that’s not always the case. If you’ve tried the above methods to fix the 22E error code, and are still experiencing issues, it may be time to call in a repair technician! There may be underlying issues affecting the evaporator fan that they’ll be able to find with their years of diagnosing experience.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

While going through your freshly dried clothes, you notice rips, tears, and holes that weren't there before. Your dryer may be damaging your clothes! And if you've been hearing odd sounds from your machine, it's high time to investigate. It might be because of an easy-to-fix issue, or perhaps the drum, seals, rollers, or glides are showing their age.\n\nIs Your Washer or Dryer Damaging Your Clothes?\nMaybe you're not sure if it's your washer or dryer creating those mysterious rips. Trying to pinpoint whether your washer or dryer is ruining your clothes can be a bit of detective work. Here's what you can do: \n\nListening to Your Washer and Dryer\nRun an empty cycle on both your washing machine and dryer. Listen carefully. If either of them produces loud rattling, scratching, or scraping noises, it can mean there's a stray object inside or maybe a part isn't working properly.\n\nDoing Your Laundry with Rags or Old Clothes\nYou can try washing and drying some old clothes or rags you no longer need. This way, you can see if they get damaged without ruining your favorite outfits.\n\nIf these test clothes come out just fine, take another look at your damaged clothes. If you notice several small holes that grow over time, it might not be your machines but moths or bugs. You will need to address the infestation using pest control measures. \n\nUnderstanding Different Types of Clothes Damage\nIf you suspect that it’s your dryer that's damaging your clothes, different parts might be causing the types of damage you see: \n\n\nMy clothes are getting snagged: Clothes might get caught if the filter cover is out of place or has sharp edges. Also, tiny objects can get wedged inside the drum and pull at your clothes.\nMy clothes have holes in them: Damaged or rough sections on the drum assembly can create holes in your laundry as it rotates.\nMy clothes are ripped and torn: When the parts that help the drum spin smoothly (like the support rollers or glides) wear down, the drum can shift and create a pinch point where clothes can get caught and rip. Missing felt seals can also lead to torn clothes as they trap clothing between the drum and outer housing.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Guide for a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nIf you notice your dryer is causing clothes to tear, it might not seem like a big deal, but it could lead to a serious problem – a dryer fire. \n\nWhen clothes get damaged, they leave behind more lint. This lint is highly flammable, and if it builds up in your dryer's vents and ducts, it can block airflow and cause the dryer to run too hot. Leaving broken parts unaddressed may also lead to electrical issues and up the chances of a fire.\n\nFollow these steps, and your dryer will be up and spinning again in no time: \n\nCommon Issues Causing Clothes Damage\nBefore cracking open your dryer, make sure you’re not making these common mistakes:  \n\nAre you running your dryer with the correct cycle? Spinning delicate garments too fast or using too much heat can harm them. Familiarize yourself with the care labels on your clothes; they tell you the best way to dry them.\nAre you overloading your dryer? Jamming too many clothes into your dryer causes the drum and the components supporting it to warp and wear out faster. A good rule of thumb is to not fill the drum more than three-quarters full.\n\n\nSafety Precautions\nDon’t forget to disconnect the dryer from its power source. To do this, simply unplug the dryer from the wall, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or turn off the correct breaker in your circuit breaker panel. You may also need to pull the dryer away from the wall to give yourself space to work.\n\nHow to Fix the Filter Cover in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nThe filter cover, typically located at the front or top of the dryer when you open the door, holds the lint filter in place. If it is broken or not sitting right, it may have sharp edges that can catch clothing as they’re tumbling.\n\nHow to Access, Inspect, and Replace the Filter Cover in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nIf the lint trap doesn't fit snugly, there may be debris buildup in the trap's slot. To address this, open your dryer door and pull out the lint trap. Using a long slender brush, reach into the shaft to dislodge any lint and then clean it with a handheld vacuum that has a crevice tool nozzle attached.\n\nOnce cleaned, insert the lint trap back in, ensuring it sits flush without any protruding edges. If it fits snugly and has no rough edges, you're good to go. If not, consider replacing it.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nHow to Fix the Drum Assembly in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nThe drum in your dryer is the part that spins and holds your clothes while they dry. If your clothes are getting torn or snagged, it could be because of a damaged part in the drum or because things that have been left in pockets, like keys, are stuck inside.\n\nYou will need to open the dryer cabinet to reach the drum itself. Because every dryer model is a bit different, having your user manual nearby will be helpful. The manual will show you how to open up your dryer's cabinet correctly.\n\nHow to Remove the Kickplate in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nSome dryers have a panel at the bottom front, called a kickplate. If it has interior spring catches, you will need to use a putty knife to press on and release them. \n\nIf not, you'll probably find screws at the bottom. Just unscrew these, then gently pull down on the kickplate to take it off the dryer.\n\nHow to Remove the Top Panel in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nDoes your dryer have a console panel on top of the cabinet? If so, start there. Begin by removing any end caps, followed by the console screws. Once they're out, slide and flip up the console to access additional screws at the back of the cabinet top. Remove these and slide the cabinet top towards you and lift it off the unit.\n\nFor most dryers, there are also spring catches under the top panel, usually one on the left and one on the right. Use a putty knife to disengage them. For some models, the screws securing the cabinet top are found inside the door; open it and remove these screws. Slide the cabinet top forward and lift it off the unit.\n\nRemember, the exact locations of the screws and catches might vary slightly depending on the make and model of your dryer, so always consult your dryer's user manual when in doubt.\n\nHow to Remove the Front Panel in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nWhen removing your dryer's front panel, keep in mind that the weight of the drum is resting on it. So, if you're not careful, the drum might fall or move.\n\nIf it has two bottom screws, start by slightly loosening them without taking them out completely. You might also find more screws either inside the top or near the door, which need to be removed.\n\nAfter all the screws are undone, gently disconnect the door switch and any other wiring, making a mental note or take a picture to remember their placements for reassembly. Hold onto the drum to keep it steady and then gently tilt the front panel away from the dryer before removing it.\n\nIf your dryer has a front bulkhead, find any screws that are attaching it to the unit so you can remove them and separate the bulkhead from the drum.\n\nHow to Remove the Drum Assembly in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nNow, you can release the belt that's around the drum. To do this, reach under the drum until you find the idler pulley arm. Push on it with your thumb to make it loose. Then, use your fingers to slip the belt off the motor pulley before carefully letting go of the idler pulley arm. You may have to do your best to hold the dryer in place while you remove the belt tension.\n\nAfter the belt is loose, you can easily slide the drum out of the cabinet frame.\n\nHow to Inspect the Drum Assembly in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging \tClothes\nBefore looking inside your dryer's drum, gather a nylon stocking or a similar item and roll it up. Gently move it all around the inside of the drum. If it gets caught or stuck in any spot, that's probably where your clothes are getting damaged. If the drum is broken in any way, you'll need a new drum.\n\nIf the drum looks good but was just sitting wrong, you will need to check its supporting parts, like the seals, guides, and rollers. The next section will tell you about checking the rollers that help the drum turn. Hold off on putting the drum back for now.\n\nBut if the drum was positioned correctly and you've got a new one to put in, you can go ahead and install the replacement drum assembly into the dryer.\n\nHow to Replace the Drum Assembly in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nStart by wrapping the belt around the drum. Reach under the drum and make sure the two rollers underneath the drum fit perfectly into the drum's back groove.\n\nWith the drum in place, align the belt to it. Create tension in the belt by making a loop with it and slipping the loop under the idler pulley arm. Then, wrap the belt loop around the motor pulley.\n\nNow, you can put the front panel back on the same way you took it off. Try turning the drum around by hand a few times. Pay close attention to the belt to ensure it lies flat and even all the way around the drum's circumference. Check the rear seal to ensure it is not pinched or caught around the drum anywhere. Once that's good, you can put the rest of the dryer back together.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nHow to Fix the Drum Support Rollers in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nYour dryer's drum is supported by little wheels called rollers. Most dryers have a pair of these wheels at the back, and some have another pair at the front. Over time, the axles that hold these wheels can wear out, making the rollers wobbly. When this happens, the drum dips down and creates a space at the bottom where clothes might get stuck.\n\nHow to Access and Inspect the Drum Support Rollers in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nTo see these rollers, you should've already taken out the drum from earlier steps. The rollers can be at the bottom of a part called the front bulkhead, or they can be behind the drum.\n\nIf you're looking at the front rollers, place the front bulkhead on a flat area. For the back rollers, you'll see them since the drum is already out. To see if a roller is bad, try turning each one.\n\nIf a roller is shaky or hard to turn, you should replace it. Sometimes, one roller can get old faster than the other. That's normal, but it's still a good idea to replace all of them at the same time. These rollers can be held by a nut or a clip, so you'll need to take that off first before changing the roller.\n\nHow to Replace the Drum Support Rollers in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nDiscard the worn drum support rollers and replace them with new ones. Put just a drop of oil on the hub. Don't use too much oil, because it will collect dust and lint, which can shorten the life of your rollers.\n\n  \n  \n \n\nHow to Fix the Drum Seal in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nNow you can move onto inspecting the drum seals.\n\nFelt seals are used to keep the hot air from escaping from around the drum. Depending on the dryer model, there might be a felt seal at the front of the drum, or there could be one at the front and another at the back. If this felt gets ripped or goes missing, clothes can get stuck between the big drum and the dryer's outer cover, which is called a shroud.\n\nHow to Access and Inspect the Drum Seal in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nPut the drum on the ground and take a close look at the seals. Remember, not all dryers have two seals; some have just one. See if there are any signs of wear or damage in the seals that could be causing problems with your clothes. Check if it is seated firmly in place around the drum's opening.\n\nHow to Replace the Drum Seal in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nIf a seal looks old or worn out, it needs to be replaced. Strip the old seal off from the dryer drum. Scrape and clean off as much of the old adhesive as you can. If your new seal doesn't come with its own sealant, make sure to get a tube of some. Squeeze the sealant tube under the felt seal, spreading it lightly and evenly around the edge. Wait a few hours for the adhesive to dry fully before you put the drum back in the dryer. Place the new seal where you removed the old one, ensuring that the stitched side faces downward.\n\nHow to Fix the Drum Glides in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nLast but not least, let's turn our attention to the drum glides.\n\nDrum glides, also known as slides, are the small plastic pieces that support the front part of the drum so that it can move smoothly. They keep the drum lifted, but over time, they can wear down. When they do, the drum may droop at the front, creating a pinch point at the top where clothes can get torn.\n\nHow to Access and Inspect the Drum Glides in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nWith the dryer’s cabinet opened, look for the glides. They could be around the rim of the drum or on a supporting panel at the back of the front cover. You can usually pop them off with something flat like a screwdriver. If they're held on with a rivet, you might need to remove them with a drill, as seen below:\n\nWhile they might not look heavily worn, replacing them is advised to prevent future issues.\n\nHow to Replace the Drum Glides in a Dryer That is Tearing or Snagging Clothes\nIf you decide to replace your dryer's drum glides, slide the new glides into their spots, and secure them with a rivet gun if they are held in place by rivets.\n\nPhew!

The 'EC' code indicates an issue within the sealed system of the dehumidifier, which is made up of key components of the dehumidifier and how it functions. Luckily, we have the answers you need to help you figure out your next steps so you can eventually have a working dehumidifier!\n\nWhat Does Frigidaire Dehumidifier 'EC' Code Mean?\nThe 'EC' code that appears on your Frigidaire dehumidifier signals an issue within the sealed system of the appliance, which will cause your dehumidifier to shut off. The sealed system is comprised of the compressor, condenser coils, evaporator, and the refrigerant that cycles through the entire system.\n\nHow Does Frigidaire Dehumidifier 'EC' Code Happen?\n\nAlthough not explicitly defined as the cause by the manufacturer, the 'EC' code is caused by issues within the condenser coils. This may be the coils that are dirty or clogged, or coils freezing from a lack of refrigerant in the system. The answer is not identical for every dehumidifier, but it occurs when a crack or faulty seal within the system allows refrigerant to leak.\n\nHow to Detect a Refrigerant Leak\n\nRefrigerant will appear foggy, smell pungently sweet, and produce a hissing noise when it leaks. Depending on how much refrigerant you're exposed to, you will likely suffer headaches, dizziness or nausea with exposure to greater amounts of refrigerant. However, it's important to remember that if you notice any of these symptoms and your dehumidifier is producing these noises or smells, remove your dehumidifier from your home, ventilate your living space(s), and seek medical attention if necessary. Refrigerant is also flammable, so depending on how much refrigerant has leaked, smoking or bringing open flames in close proximity to a leak can be extremely dangerous.\n\nAgain, the cause for each specific unit will vary and will depend on several different factors, but there are ways to remedy the situation before seeking a technician or replacement.\n\nWhat To Do If You See a Frigidaire EC Error Code\n\nReset Your Frigidaire Dehumidifier to Clear the EC Error Code\nResetting your dehumidifier is a good method of clearing an error that appears due to a temporary glitch or issue. Resetting your Frigidaire dehumidifier may be as easy as using a button on the touchpad, if one is present. If your model does not have a reset button, you can reset it by disconnecting it from the wall outlet and leaving it for 30 minutes before plugging it back in, to see whether the error code is cleared and functionality is restored. This method can be effective, however, it's often only temporary, and if the EC code returns or doesn't clear, you will need to explore other options.\nWarranty and Replacement Options if Frigidaire Dehumidifier EC Error Code Won't Clear\nUnfortunately, the EC error code is one of a few dehumidifier issues that brings bad news from our expert repair technician, Chris: This is not an easy repair; it is expensive if the appliance is outside its warranty period and will not be worth it for most people. Refrigerant is toxic and working with it is ill-advised, and accessing and replacing condenser coils is a genuine challenge. Contacting a technician is an option, however, due to the average price of a household dehumidifier, you may want to begin considering a replacement mindset if the issue persists. Next steps would be to contact Frigidaire and Electrolux directly and check your dehumidifier's warranty for replacement or repair. Depending on your model and how long ago you purchased it, you may still have a warranty on it which can be used to cover any replacement costs.\nPrevent Future EC Error Codes on Your Frigidaire Dehumidifier\nWhether you were able to clear the EC error code with a hard reset, or you own a newer model and want to prevent this issue, there are a few things you can do to improve the longevity of the sealed system and condenser coils and prevent any EC codes from appearing:\n\n\nClean Your Dehumidifier Regularly: Whether this is done once a week or every few days, giving your dehumidifier and its filter a quick vacuum, dusting, or wipe-down can make a huge impact in its overall performance. If your current filter is a mess and needs replacing, you can find one in our dehumidifier filter inventory page!\nKeep It Ventilated: Often users will put their dehumidifier in a corner or against a wall to the point where it cannot breathe. Ensuring it has room to properly pull and push air is vital.\nReset Your Dehumidifier: This may not be an option for your model, but resetting your dehumidifier with a button on the touchpad, or by disconnecting it from the wall outlet temporarily can restore functionality and clear an 'EC' code.\n\n\n\nAlthough our goal is to always encourage DIY repair as much as possible, we understand that it's not always practical, safe, or cost-effective. Ensuring you know the reality of the Frigidaire dehumidifier EC error code, and how you can get back to the life you want, is of utmost importance to us!

This type of issue may also be displayed as an HF error code, and will happen to Maytag models along with Whirlpool. You may notice that the washer does not fill properly, cannot detect the presence of water, or can not run a cycle. This error is often displayed when the water supply to the washer has been switched off or when there is a faulty part in the water intake system. This washer guide will help you better understand the reasons behind this error code and guide you, step-by-step, through the troubleshooting process. By the end of this guide, you'll be armed with the knowledge and confidence to restore the flow of water in your washer and clear the F20/HF error code. \n\nCauses of the Whirlpool or Maytag Washer F20/HF Error and How to Fix Them\n\nImportant Tips to Know Before Troubleshooting\n\n\nFor your safety, always unplug your washing machine, and shut off the water supply valves before starting any maintenance or repair.\nIf you’re disconnecting the washer or changing the hoses, always turn off the water supply first to prevent any water spillage or leaks.\nAfter turning the water supply back on, it's a good idea to check for any leaks at the connection points on the washer and the wall.\n \n\nControl Board Glitch\nThe control board manages and interprets signals from all of the washer's sensors and components. If it malfunctions, it could misinterpret signals from the water intake system or fail to activate components correctly, resulting in an F20 error. To clear a glitch on your Whirlpool or Maytag washer you can reset it using any of the following methods:\n\nHow to Reset the Washer to Clear the F20/HF Error\n\n\nPress the Pause/Start button twice in quick succession.\nSoft Rest: Unplug the washer from the power outlet and wait 1-3 minutes before plugging it back in.\nHard Reset: Turn the washer off at the circuit breaker and wait 3 - 5 minutes before turning it on again.\n\n\nEither one of these methods should allow you to reset your washer. To receive more detailed instructions on resetting your washer, check out our resetting a whirlpool washer guide. However, if the problem persists then you will need to move on to troubleshooting the washer in order to clear the F20 code.\n\nUsing Incorrect Detergent\nUsing Incorrect Detergent: Your Whirlpool or Maytag washer requires the use of the correct amount of a High-Efficiency detergent. Using a non-HE detergent or using excessive amounts of detergent can create too many suds inside the washer. These suds can interfere with the machine's ability to gauge the water level, thereby causing an F20 error.\n\nHow to Remove Excess Suds from the Washer Tub to Clear F20/HF Error\n\n\nIf your washer is filled with soapy water first select the \"Drain & Spin\" cycle to remove the soapy water. This might need to be done a couple of times to ensure all the suds and soapy water are cleared out.\nIf your model does not have this option, simply run a rinse cycle instead, to remove the water. It is recommended to add a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle, as vinegar can help break down the suds.\nOnce you have cleaned the suds, use a soft cloth to wipe the interior of the drum and ensure that no soap residues remain.\nRun a short cycle without detergent and confirm that the F20 error has been resolved. \n\n\n\nDisconnected Water Supply\nWater supply hoses bring water from your home's plumbing into the washing machine. If the water supply is completely disconnected or not turned on, the washer won't receive the water it needs, leading to the F20 error due to the lack of water.\n\nHow to Turn On Your Water Supply Valves to Clear the F20/HF Error\n\n\nLocate the two water supply valves behind the washer: one for hot water (often colored red) and one for cold water (often colored blue).\nSwitch on the water supply by turning each valve counterclockwise until it's fully open.\nIf you are still experiencing issues with the water supply, confirm there aren’t any public water works or other external factors that may be affecting the water supply.\n\n\n\nLow Water Pressure Levels\nIf the water pressure to your home or specifically to your washer is too low, it might not fill up quickly enough to satisfy the washer's sensors. The machine's sensors will detect the lack of timely filling and trigger the F20 error in response.\n\nHow to Check the Water Pressure Levels\n\n\nYou can test your home's water pressure using a gauge. Attach it to a water source, and turn the water on. \nThe gauge will provide a reading in psi (pounds per square inch). A typical home water pressure is around 50 to 70 psi. If your reading is significantly lower, you may have a problem with your home's water supply.\nAlternatively you can find out your psi by contacting your local water utility company.\nIf you have other appliances connected to the same water source, ensure they aren’t using water simultaneously, as this can reduce water pressure and result in the F20 error.\nIf you’ve recently installed a water softener or filtration system, ensure it’s functioning correctly, as these systems can sometimes reduce water pressure. \n\n\n\nBlocked Water Inlet Filters\nThe water inlet filters (or screens) are found where the water inlet hoses connect to the back of the washer. They are designed to catch debris and contaminants to ensure that only clean water enters the washing machine. Over time they can become clogged, and restrict the flow of water into the machine, which can trigger the F20 error. You will need to clean these filters or replace them.\n\nHow to Clean and Replace the Water Inlet Filters to Clear the F20/HF Error\n\n\nUsing pliers, unscrew the water hoses from the back of the washing machine. Make sure you have a towel or bucket nearby as it is normal for some water to spill out at this point. \nOnce the hoses are removed, you should see the water inlet valve's small filters, situated right where the hoses connect.\nCarefully remove the filters using a pair of needle-nose pliers. Be gentle to avoid damaging them. \nRinse the dirty filters under warm running water. You can use an old toothbrush to scrub away any debris or buildup gently. If the filters are worn down, it is best to discard them at this point and get a \nreplacement water inlet filter.\nCarefully place the filters back into their respective slots.\nReattach the hoses to the correct hot/cold mounts and ensure they're securely fitted but not overtightened, as this can damage the threads or the washer itself. \nSlowly turn the water supply valves back on and check for any leaks around the hose connections.\nReconnect the washing machine to the power source.\nRun a short wash cycle to ensure everything is functioning properly and that there are no leaks.\n\n\n\nKinked or Blocked Inlet Hoses\nThe water inlet hoses are responsible for delivering water to the washing machine from your home's water supply. If they are kinked or blocked by a foreign object, they can restrict or stop the flow of water, leading to insufficient water in the drum and triggering the F20 error. \nHow to Inspect the Water Inlet Hoses to Clear the F20/HF Error\n\n\nPull the washing machine from the wall to access the rear end.\nPlace a bucket or towel beneath the hoses to catch any water that might spill. \nUnthread the hoses from the washing machine's back and from the wall, or laundry sink.\nVisually examine the entire length of each hose for any visible damage, kinks, or bends.\nRun high-pressure water through the hose to push out any obstructions. \nAttach the hoses back to the washing machine and be careful to connect them to the correct hot and cold inlets. \nReconnect the other end of the hoses to your water supply. Turn the water supply valves on and check for any leaks.\nOnce everything is reassembled and there are no leaks, plug the washer back into the power source.\nRun a Test Cycle to ensure that the F20 code is cleared, and the washer fills with water correctly.\n\n\n\nFaulty Pressure Switch\nThe pressure switch (water level switch), which is typically found in the washer's control panel or the back of the washer, is responsible for detecting the water level in the drum. It ensures that the water is neither too low nor too high for the washer. If it's faulty, it may be unable to detect the water levels, even if they are sufficient, thus leading to the F20 error. \nHow to Access and Test the Pressure Switch\n\n\nOn some Whirlpool or Maytag models, the control panel is held in place by screws, and you will need to use a screwdriver to release it. On other models, it is secured by spring clips, and you will need to use a putty knife to push in and release these clips.\nOnce released, the control panel will either hinge backward or lift off.\nLocate the Pressure Switch, which Is typically a round component with a rubber hose connected to it.\nInspect the switch for obvious damage or signs of wear. If any is present, the switch will need to be replaced. If none is present, you may need to test the switch for electrical failure using a multimeter.\nTo test the switch, first remove the hose from the switch.\nNext, set your multimeter to the resistance (Ohms) setting, and place the probes on the switch's terminals.\nPress down on the switch's actuator (it may be a small button or lever), and if the switch is functioning correctly, you should see a change in resistance when you press and release the actuator.\nIf there is no reading, you will need to replace the pressure switch as this is a signal that it has failed.  \n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Pressure Switch to Clear the F20/HF Error\n\n\nGently pull the wiring connector(s) off the pressure switch.\nRelease the tab or remove the screw that holds the pressure switch in place.\nPosition the new pressure switch in place, secure it with the mounting tab or screw and reconnect the wiring harness.\nConnect the hose to the new pressure switch. Make sure it's securely in place.\nPlace the control panel back in its original position and secure it with screws or ensure the spring clips are engaged.\nthe washer to power, and run a test cycle to ensure everything is functioning correctly.\n\n\n\nFaulty Flow Meter\nThe flow meter or flow sensor is located near the water inlet valve and it measures the amount of water entering the washer. If it is faulty, it may be unable to accurately gauge the water level or may read the level as insufficient. \n\nHow to Access and Test the Flow Meter\n\n\nRemove the top panel or the back panel of the washer to access the interior.\nLocate the flow meter near the water inlet valve. it will have wires and hoses connected to it.\nCheck the flow meter for any signs of damage, cracking, or wear. Ensure all connections (hoses and wires) are secure. \nIf there are no signs of damage, test the flow meter with a multimeter for an electrical fault.\nGently pull the wiring connectors off the flow meter. Connect the multimeter probes to the flow meter's terminals.\nBlow air through the flow meter. You should see a change in the multimeter reading as the internal wheel moves. If there's no reading, you will likely need to find a replacement flow meter.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Flow Meter to Clear the F20/HF Error\n\n\nCarefully remove the hoses attached to the flow meter and use a towel or container to catch water that may spill out. \nRemove the mounting hardware that secures the faulty flow meter.\nPosition your new flow meter in the same place, as the old one, secure it, then reconnect the hoses and wiring connectors.\nReplace the top or back panel and secure it with screws.\nAfter everything is reassembled, plug the washer back in and run a test cycle to ensure it's functioning correctly.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the F20 error in your Whirlpool or Maytag washer is essential for ensuring the longevity and efficient functioning of your machine. By following the troubleshooting steps detailed in this article, you can identify and resolve the source of the problem in your water intake system, potentially saving time and money on professional repairs.

Depending on your washer model, you may see either 4C or 4E on the display, however, they mean the same thing, and whether you own a front-load or a top-load washer, the troubleshooting steps are the same for both error codes. Typically, the 4C or 4E error code have a few major causes: a control board glitch, clogged detergent dispenser/mesh filter, and a water valve behind the washer that's not fully opened are all very simple and common items to check first. The codes may also point to a greater underlying issue with your home's water supply, like low water pressure issues, or more serious still, a burst/frozen pipe. These issues will require immediate attention. In terms of parts, the water inlet valve is the most likely faulty component to cause this code, so if you've checked the other common issues, this part will remain the one to troubleshoot. By the end of this guide, you will fully understand these causes of the 4C or 4E error and be well-equipped to find the fault and clear the code.\n\n6 Causes of the Samsung Washer 4C/4E Error Code and How to Fix Them\n\nControl Board Glitch\nThe control board manages and controls all of the washer's functions. If it experiences a glitch it may be unable to monitor or measure the water levels in the washer or communicate that there is sufficient water. Resetting the washer should resolve any minor issues and clear the 4C or 4E error. However, if the error is still present after resetting the washer, then you will need to move through the troubleshooting instructions provided below. \n\nHow to Reset (Power Cycle) Samsung Washer to Fix the 4C or 4E Error Code\n\n\nUnplug the washing machine from the power outlet, and wait 1 - 3 minutes before plugging it back in.\nIf the method above does not work, try switching off the power at the circuit breaker. Wait for 1 to 5 minutes, and then switch the power back on.\n\n\n\nClogged Detergent Dispenser\nIf you regularly use more detergent than is recommended or use non-HE (high efficiency) detergent, the detergent dispenser may become clogged with built-up soap residue. A clogged dispenser drawer might cause water to overflow or not flow correctly within the washing machine, thereby triggering the 4C (4E) error. You will need to remove the buildup to fix the error. To maintain the longevity of your washer, be sure to use the correct amount of detergent and consider opting for liquid detergents which are less likely to cause build-ups than powdered ones. \n\nHow to Clean the Detergent Dispenser to Fix the 4C or 4E Error\n\n\nEnsure the washing machine is turned off and unplugged from the electrical outlet before starting any cleaning. \nOpen the dispenser drawer and push down on the release lever while pulling the drawer out at the same time. \nClean the drawer using warm, running water or fill the sink basin with warm water and allow the detergent dispenser drawer to soak for a few minutes. \nIf the build-up is heavy, use a soft brush or an old toothbrush and a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar to help dissolve the residues. \nUsing the same brush or a damp cloth, gently scrub the inside of the compartment where the detergent drawer sits in the washing machine. \nOnce everything is clean and dry, slide the detergent drawer back into its slot.\nRun a short cycle to confirm that the error code has cleared and the water flow is restored.\n\n\n\nLow Water Pressure\nIf the water flowing into your washing machine from the main water supply has low pressure, the washer may not fill up in the set time, or may not fill up at all, resulting in the 4C or 4E error. Your pressure reading should fall between between 20 psi and 120 psi. If it falls out of this range, you should check that the valves are fully open and the hoses are well connected. You can test the water pressure of your home's water supply using a water pressure test gauge or by calling your local water utility company. \n\nHow to Test Water Pressure Levels for Your Samsung Washer\n\n\nPull the washer away from the wall to access the main water supply valve.\nPlace a dish or towel underneath the water supply hose, and slowly disconnect it from the valve.\nAttach a pressure gauge to one of the valves and turn the valve until it is fully open. \nCheck that the reading on the gauge falls within the standard range needed for your washer.\n\n\n\nIf you confirm water pressure issues in your home when troubleshooting this error code, it's important to note that you could be dealing with a frozen/burst pipe issue, especially if you've been experiencing below-freezing temperatures in your area and you have exposed pipes in uninsulated areas of your home. The 4C/4E error code will appear on your washer, but water pressure/supply issues will be prevalent throughout all water sources in your home. It is important to call a plumber immediately if you fear you may be dealing with a frozen or otherwise burst pipe.\n\nWater Tap Not Fully Opened\nThe water supply tap is a manual valve found on the wall behind the washer. When it is open, it allows water to flow to the washer. If it is not completely open, the flow of water will be restricted and insufficient to run the washer, triggering the 4C (4E) error.\n\nHow to Open the Water Tap to Fix the 4C or 4E Error Code\n\n\nTurn the washer off and disconnect it from the power source.\nPull the washer forward to access the back wall.\nTurn the water tap counterclockwise as far as it will comfortably go to open it.\nReconnect the washer to the power outlet and run a short cycle to ensure that the code is resolved and the water enters the drum without any issues.\n\n\n\nKinked or Blocked Water Supply Hoses\nThe water supply hoses, (inlet hoses) are responsible for transporting water from the home’s main supply to the washer. If the hoses are kinked or pinched, clogged, or they are not securely connected, they can restrict the flow of water, leak, and reduce the water pressure, resulting in the 4C error. \n\nHow to Clean the Water Supply Hoses to Fix the 4C or 4E Error Code\n\n\nTurn off the washing machine and unplug it from the wall outlet. \nTurn off the water supply valves for both hot and cold water. \nPull the washer from the wall to access the water supply hoses.\nConfirm that the hoses are not bent awkwardly or pinched.\nPlace a small dish or a towel underneath the water supply hoses, as water will likely spill out when you remove the hoses. \nRemove the mounting hardware that secures the hoses to the back of the washer. \nNext, disconnect the other end of the hoses from the water supply valves. \nInspect the hose to check for any visible clogs or obstructions. If any are present, run high-pressure water through the hose or use a long brush to gently push it out.  \nOnce the hoses are clean you, screw the hoses back onto the washer and the water supply valves.  \nTurn the water supply valves back on and check for any leaks. \nPlug the washer back into the wall outlet and run a short cold water cycle without any clothes in it. This will help flush out any remaining debris and ensure everything is working correctly. \n\n \n\nClogged Mesh Filters\nThe water supply mesh filters/inlet filters traps debris and sediment to prevents it from flowing into washing machine from the household water supply. These screens can get clogged over time and restrict the flow of water to the washer, resulting in the 4C (4E) error code. They should be cleaned regularly, and it is recommended to replace the filters every 6 months. \n\nHow to Clean the Mesh Filters to Fix the 4C or 4E Error Code\n\n\nPlace a bucket or towels near the water supply hoses to catch any water that might spill out when you remove the hoses. \nCarefully unthread the water supply hoses from the back of the washer. \nLook inside the inlet valves on the back of the washer to locate the mesh filter.  \nRemove the mesh filter using a pair of needle-nose pliers.\nIf the filters are dirty, you can clean them under running water or use an old toothbrush to gently scrub away the buildup. You can also soak them in water and vinegar to loosen the debris.  \nIf the mesh filters are damaged or excessively worn down, you can use our model search feature to find new filters that are the correct size and type for your specific Samsung washer model. \nTo install the new screens, gently press them into place inside the inlet valve fittings using your fingers. \nReconnect the water supply hoses to the back of the washer.\nTurn the water supply valves back on and check for any leaks at the hose connections.\nPlug the washer back in and run a short rinse cycle to ensure the flow of water is restored.\n\n\n\nFaulty Water Inlet Valve\nThe primary function of the water inlet valves is to regulate the flow of water into the washing machine. When your washer needs water for a cycle, the control board sends an electrical signal to the inlet valve, which allows it to open and allow water to flow into the drum. if it is damaged or experiencing an electrical fault, it will be unable to control the water flow or let water enter the machine, leading to the 4C (4E) error. To check for electrical failure, use a multimeter to test for continuity, if there is no reading you will need to find a replacement water inlet valve. \n\nHow to Replace a Faulty Water Inlet Valve\n\n\nUnplug the washing machine from the electrical outlet, and turn off the water supply to the washer.\nMove the washing machine away from the wall so you have enough space to work behind it.\nPlace a small dish or towel underneath the water hoses and carefully disconnect the water hoses from the back of the washing machine.\nLocate the screws holding the rear panel of the washer in place and carefully unthread them to access the inlet valves.\nUnplug the wire connectors from the faulty water inlet valve.\nRemove the screws holding the inlet valve in place, and carefully pull it out of the washer.  \nPosition the new water inlet valve where the old one was, and mount it in place using the appropriate screws.\nReconnect the wiring to the new valve.\nPlace the back panel onto the washer and secure it with the screws you removed earlier.\nReconnect the water hoses to the new inlet valve, ensuring the hot and cold hoses are mounted in the correct positions.\nRun a short cycle to test that the new valve is working correctly and to check for any leaks.\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \nAs you can see, there can be various reasons why your Samsung washer is displaying the 4C (4E) error. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to ensure the longevity and efficiency of your washing machine. Regular maintenance, such as checking the water hoses and cleaning the mesh filters, can reduce the chances of this error popping up. Being proactive will not only save you time and money in repairs but will also ensure that your laundry days remain hassle-free.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

This prevents the machine from being opened mid-cycle, which would result in water leaking out or poses a hazard from the rapidly spinning basket. However, if the cycle has finished yet your laundry is still locked inside the machine, that’s when it becomes an issue. In this article we’ll discuss what situations are normal when your Whirlpool washer is locked, and which are issues that may require a repair. You’ll have your clean laundry free from the washer and in the dryer in no time!\n\nThe Difference Between Top-Load and Front-Load Washer Locks\n\nTop-Load Whirlpool Washers\n\nIf your Whirlpool washer is a top-load model, that means it has a “lid” instead of a “door.” Older models of top-load washers would allow you to begin filling the machine with water the same time you were adding your laundry. Newer models will no longer fill with water when the lid is raised, it must be lowered in place for the wash cycle to start. You typically have some time to lift the lid to add some forgotten socks to the load, but within a few minutes of starting the cycle the lid will lock in place and you won’t be able to raise it without pausing the cycle.\n\nThe lid locking mechanism is an important safety feature, and not something that you should try to bypass. Washer baskets in top-load machines spin at extremely fast revolutions in order to remove the water from your laundry. Opening the washer lid while this spins and reaching inside could cause serious injuries. For this reason, modern Whirlpool top-load washers will lock the lid while the machine is running, and the lid will not unlock until the motor has completely stopped. It can take a few minutes for the washer to stop completely, this is normal! The display on your washer control board should have a light that indicates where the washer is in the cycle, and if the machine lid is locked or unlocked. Be sure to wait until the light is out before attempting to open the washer lid, you could damage the machine if you force it open.\n\nFront-Load Whirlpool Washers\n\nIf your Whirlpool washer is a front-load model, it has a door instead of a lid. If the door were to be opened mid-cycle with a front-load washer, you may end up with water flowing out of your machine onto the floor. There is also the safety factors as the water can be quite hot, or the spinning basket may cause injuries. If the door to your Whirlpool washer is locked while the machine is running, do not try to force it open. Pause or cancel the cycle and wait for the washer to stop completely. The “door lock” display light will go out once it is safe for you to open the washer door. If the door does not unlock, continue reading below for troubleshooting or repair tips.\n\nWhy is the Door Lock Light Flashing on Your Whirlpool Washer?\n\nIf the lid or door lock light is flashing on your Whirlpool washer, there is an issue that is preventing the machine from locking, and it requires your attention. This is typically a case of the door or lid NOT locking, instead of staying stuck locked. On a top-load washer, there may be debris like detergent or lint buildup that prevents the lock switch and the striker from connecting. If cleaning this out does not resolve the issue, you may need to further inspect for misalignment, or replace these parts.\n\nFor a front-load Whirlpool washer with a flashing door lock light, first check to make sure there isn’t laundry stuck in the door jamb, preventing it from closing. If that wasn’t the issue, check the latch and striker on the door to make sure they aren’t gummed up with debris. If cleaning these parts doesn’t solve the locking issue, you may need to do some further inspecting and replace some parts.\n\nTroubleshooting a Whirlpool Washer That Won’t Unlock\n\nIf your laundry has finished in the washer, or you have paused the cycle, yet you’re unable to open the lid or door there is an issue with your Whirlpool washer. It could be with the locking mechanism, or a bigger issue like the drain pump (the washer won’t allow the door to open if the machine is still full of water). So long as the motor has stopped and your machine isn’t full of water, begin working through the following troubleshooting tips to unlock your Whirlpool washer.\n\nThe first thing to try is pressing the “control lock” button for three seconds. After the three seconds have passed, the door should unlock allowing you to open it.\n\nIf the control lock button doesn’t work, next is to try the “end of cycle” button if your machine has that option. Holding this button in will reset your washer, and then you should be able to open the door.\n\nIf the “end cycle” button also does not help, the next thing to try is completely resetting the machine. This is the classic “turn it off and back on again” method. To do this, unplug your washer and leave it for about an hour. After an hour, plug your washer back in and turn it on. If you still can’t open the door or lid after this, you will need to manually unlock the washer.\n\n \nHow to Manually Unlock a Whirlpool Washer\n\nIf you’ve gotten to the point that you need to manually unlock your Whirlpool washer, then a part has failed, and you’ll need to do further inspections to find out what needs to be replaced. Whether you have a top-load or a front-load, begin by disconnecting power to the washer before you try to manually unlock it.\n\nFor a front-load washer, you can access the latch through either the toe-plate or by removing the top panel. Either way will require a screwdriver to remove the panel so that you can reach inside the washer frame. When reaching in near the door latch assembly, you should feel a circular tab. Pushing or pulling this tab should release the door latch, allowing the washer door to open.\n\nFor a top-load washer, you can use a putty knife to release the locking tabs for the top panel. Depending on your model, you may need to disconnect the back console before the lid will lift up. With the top panel raised, you’ll be able to get to the laundry in the drum, along with accessing the lid switch to inspect it. \n\nParts to Inspect to Unlock a Whirlpool Washer\n\nThe following are common parts that may have failed, resulting in your Whirlpool washer door or lid staying locked. Inspecting and replacing these are generally a simple DIY process, but if you are not comfortable doing your own repairs, don’t hesitate to call in a professional repair technician. Before doing any inspections or repairs yourself, be sure to disconnect power to your washer. \n\nLid Switch\n\nThe lid switch is found on top-load washers and is what keeps the machine locked while it’s running. You'll find the lid switch mounted to the underside of the washer’s top panel so you will need to lift the panel to access it. You can use a multimeter to test if the lid switch has continuity or not. If your multimeter doesn’t return a reading between 500 to 1500 ohms, the lid switch will need to be replaced. You can find genuine OEM Whirlpool lid switches by searching with your model number.\n\nTo replace the lid switch, disconnect the old one from the wire harness and discard it. Connect the new lid switch to the wire harness and secure it to the washer. \n\n \n \n\n \nLid Actuator\n\nThe lid actuator works with the lid switch on your top-load washer. The actuator presses down on the switch when the lid is closed, which lets the washer know it can start the wash cycle. If the actuator is damaged, it can prevent your washer lid from locking or unlocking. This part can wear out with normal and regular use, so it is something that may need to be replaced over time.\n\nTo replace a lid actuator, remove the damaged one by lifting the lid of your washer and releasing the locking tab or screw holding the actuator in place. Take the new actuator and install it by securing the locking tab or reinstalling the screw. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nDoor Latch\n\nIf you have a front-load washer, the door latch may be causing your locking issues. The latch assembly can be found on the inside of the washer door panel. Behind the door boot or gasket will be a wire harness which holds the door latch. Disconnect the damaged door latch from the harness, connect the new latch to the harness, and then reinstall the washer door. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nDoor Strike\n\nThe door strike works with the latch to keep your front-load washer door closed and locked. It activates the door latch so that the washer knows it it safe to begin the wash cycle. It is a small plastic part, so it can be easily damaged with regular use or if the washer door is open and closed roughly. The door strike is found on the door frame and is held in place with a couple screws. Replacing this part is as easy as unscrewing the damaged door strike and screwing a new one into place.\n\n \n \n\n \nDrain Pump\n\nWhether you have a top-load or a front-load Whirlpool washer, if there is water in the machine the washer door won’t unlock and open. This is a safety feature and prevents the water from flooding into your laundry room. An unlocking issue with your washer might be the result of a failed drain pump. First check to see if there is a clog in the pump. Items like lint or socks can cause blockages, which result in draining issues. If this was the case, once the machine has drained the door should unlock normally.\n\nIf the drain pump has any visible signs of damage, it will need to be replaced. You can also use a multimeter to test for continuity, if you don’t see any damage but your machine isn’t draining. The location and method for removing and installing a new drain pump does vary depending on if you have a top-load or front-load, so searching our YouTube channel with your model number will help ensure you find the best instructions for your washer. \n\n \nControl Board\n\nWhile the above parts are more likely to cause an unlocking issue with your washer, a control board that is failing may also prevent the door or lid from opening. If the washer is unable to send or receive the signals, the machine will remain locked. You will need to use a multimeter to test a control board for continuity. If there is a negative reading, or no reading, the control board has failed and will need to be replaced. When disconnecting and reconnecting wires to the control board, you may find it beneficial to take a photo for reference before beginning. This will help ensure you match the proper wires to the correct terminals. \n\n \n \n\n\nWhile a frustrating issue when it happens, learning how to unlock your Whirlpool washer isn’t difficult! Some routine maintenance like keeping your drain pump clear and being gentle when opening or closing the door can help keep these parts running as intended. When the time comes that a latch or switch needs replacing, you’ll now have the knowledge and DIY skills to tackle the job!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

The dryer belt, also known as a drive belt or drum belt, plays an important role in the performance of your dryer. It grips the outside of the dryer drum, to enable it to spin/rotate smoothly and circulate hot air to dry your clothes properly. Refer to the image below for reference on how the belt is positioned inside your dryer. \nSaveEmbed Image \n\nOver time the belt may fray, lose tension, or fall off leading to a host of dryer issues. This guide is designed to help you learn what causes a belt to fail prematurely, what warning signs to look out for, and how to replace it quickly and easily. The function of the belt and the process for replacing it are the same whether you own a gas or electric dryer. So, let's dive in and get your dryer running like new again!\n\nWhat Causes the Dryer Belt to Fail?\nOver the life of your dryer, it is normal for the belt to wear down and lose tension due to aging or usage. However, there are several issues that can cause the belt to tear or fall off prematurely.\n\nOverloading the Dryer\nIf you load more clothes in your dryer than it is designed to carry, the belt will be placed under excessive strain as it must work harder to support the added weight and keep the drum spinning. A heavy load will also result in high friction along the length of the belt which will cause the material to wear down and eventually tear. Overloaded dryers are more likely to overheat, and excessive heat can also cause the belt to become brittle and lose tension. To keep your dryer in optimal condition, ensure that you follow the loading instructions for your model type. \n\nLoading Soaking Wet Clothes in the Dryer\nYou should never place excessively wet clothes in your dryer. Wet clothes are much heavier than damp clothes, therefore, if you load your dryer with wet clothes, it will have the same challenges as when it is overloaded. Additionally, wet clothes reduce the dryer’s ability to circulate air through the drum efficiently. This may cause the dryer to run for longer thereby increasing your energy consumption, and keeping the belt under strain for longer as well. Regularly placing wet clothes in the dryer can eventually result in moisture damage to the dryer belt and other components of the dryer. \n\nInstalling the Wrong Belt\nIt is important to install the belt that is designed for your specific dryer model, as these belts will be the correct size, material, and design. Belts from other brands may be too tight and place excessive strain on the belt and drum, or too loose and cause the belt to slip, and potentially damage other parts of the dryer.  The wrong belt will also be unable to grip the drum properly, and may lead to further damage to your dryer. To ensure you find the right belt for your dryer, take advantage of our model search feature.\n\nSigns That the Dryer Belt Needs to Be Replaced\n\n\nVisible Belt Damage: You can view the belt by removing the top panel of the dryer (first disconnect the dryer from the power outlet before doing so). Check to see if the belt is hanging loosely or showing signs of wear such as fraying or cracks. You can also open the front door of the dryer and manually spin the drum with your hands. If it spins very easily with little resistance, then the belt has likely lost tension. All of this indicates that the belt is either near or at the end of its life and will need to be replaced. \nUnusual Noises: A faulty belt will usually result in unusual and excessive banging and tapping noises from your dryer during use. If the belt is loosed it may tap or slap against the interior of the dryer. On the other hand, if the belt has snapped, it will no longer be able to support the drum, causing the drum to bang around inside the dryer as it rotates. \nDrum Doesn’t Turn: If you start a cycle and you can hear the motor running, but the drum doesn't turn, it's a strong indication that the belt has snapped. It is important to note that for certain models of dryers, a faulty dryer belt may trigger a belt switch which prevents the motor from running as well. \nDamp Clothes: If you have noticed that your dryer is running for longer than usual and the clothes are still damp at the end of a cycle, then you likely have a faulty belt. As mentioned above, a faulty belt will be unable to support the drum, thus hindering the drum's ability to spin and circulate hot air adequately. \n\n\nHow To Remove a Faulty Dryer Belt \n\n\nAlways begin your repairs by disconnecting the appliance from the electrical outlet for your safety. \nRemove the front and top panels of the dryer to access the dryer drum. \nLocate the belt, which is fitted around the dryer drum and over the motor and idler pulleys. Take note (or a picture) of how the belt is oriented around these parts for the installation of the new belt later. \nRelease the tension on the belt by pressing the idler pulley down. Hold the idler pulley in this position and slip the belt off the motor pulley. \nCarefully pull the old belt off the drum entirely and discard it. \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n How to Install a New Dryer Belt \n\n\nGrab your new belt and place it on the drum with the grooved (ribbed) side lying flat against the drum.\nLoop the belt over the motor pulley (grooved side facing down) and under the idler pulley (grooved side facing up). Refer to your notes from earlier to ensure you have positioned the belt correctly.\nCheck that the belt doesn’t have any kinks or twists and manually rotate the drum to ensure it is properly seated and aligned.\nReinstall the top and front panels of your dryer.\nPlug the dryer back in and run a short cycle without clothes to confirm that the drum is turning smoothly once again.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nWhile wear and tear are inevitable over time, being attentive to the early signs of a failing belt can save you from potential damage to your dryer and extended downtime.

Like many modern appliances, washers too can experience minor glitches that often require just a quick reset to restore them to their regular working order. Whether you own a Whirlpool Cabrio, Duet, front-load, top-load, or combo washer, you can follow the steps laid out here to learn how to reset your washer and ensure your laundry day continues without a hitch.\n\nWhen to Reset Your Whirlpool Washer\n\n\nPerformance Issues: Over time, a washer's electronic controls can develop minor glitches due to wear or normal aging. If your washer is displaying unusual symptoms like not starting, not spinning, failing to drain, or making unexpected noises, resetting the appliance can clear these electronic hiccups.\nError code: Error codes are the washer's way of signalling that there may be a fault in the washer. Resetting the washer can clear the error code. However, it is important to note that If the error code persists after a reset, then there may be a faulty part in your washer that requires replacement.\nLoad imbalance: If your washer is not properly loaded, the washer's drum may move erratically, potentially damaging the appliance or even causing leaks. Many Whirlpool washers have sensors that detect these imbalances. Your Whirlpool washer may lock itself in a state where it refuses to spin. Resetting your washer can help recalibrate these sensors and restore your washer. \nPower surge: A sudden power surge can cause a washer's electronics to malfunction. Resetting after a power surge helps ensure that any electric issues are cleared.\nInstalling new parts: If you have recently replaced a part of your washer or performed a major repair, the machine might not immediately recognize or efficiently operate with the new part. Resetting your washer after installing a new part allows the washer to recalibrate its functions to work with this new component, much like restarting a computer after installing new software. \n\n\n\n6 Ways to Reset Your Whirlpool Washer\nThe following methods are applicable to various models of Whirlpool washers. However, if you are unsure how to proceed you can consult your owner’s manual for specific instructions or refer to the tech sheet which is typically located inside the control panel of the washer. It provides diagnostic information that can help you in troubleshooting your washer.\n\nUnplug the Washer\n\n\nPress the \"Power\" or \"Cancel\" button to turn off your washer.\nSafely unplug the washing machine from the power outlet.\nLeave the washer unplugged for about 5 minutes.\nReconnect the washing machine to the power outlet.\nPress the \"Power\" or \"Start\" button to turn your washer back on.\n\n\n\nTurn Off the Circuit Breaker\n\n\nLocate the circuit breaker in your home that corresponds to the laundry room or wherever your washer is located.\nFlip the breaker that is connected to your washing machine to the \"Off\" position.\nLeave it off for about 5 minutes.\nFlip the breaker back to the \"On\" position. \nPress the \"Power\" or \"Start\" button to turn your washer back on. \n\n\n\nPress and Hold “Start” and “Power” Buttons\n\n\nSimultaneously press \"Start\" or \"Pause\" (depending on your model), and \"Cancel\" or“Power” buttons at the same time. \nHold the buttons for about 5 seconds.\nRelease the buttons and run a short cycle to check if the washer has been reset.\n\n\n\nUse the Dial Method \nIf your Whirlpool washer has a dial instead of a digital touch panel, you can attempt to reset it using the following method. \n\n\nEnsure that the control panel is switched off.\nRotate the dial like you are setting it for a normal wash cycle.\nTurn the dial a full rotation counter clockwise (to the left) until you're back on the initial setting you started at (e.g., “Normal”).\nThen, turn the dial one click to the right (clockwise), one click to the left (counter-clockwise), one click to the right (clockwise), and finally one more click to the left (counter-clockwise).\nOnce you've completed the sequence, simply wait a moment. If the washer has reset, all the lights on the machine should turn on and then off again.\nTo check if the machine has been successfully reset, set it for a short cycle and see if it completes without issues.\n\n\n\nOpen and Close the Washer Lid\nFor many traditional Whirlpool top-load washers, particularly the ones without a digital display, the lid can be used as a method to reset the appliance. \n\n\nMake sure the washer is turned on but not currently running. \nOpen the washer's lid to its maximum height and then, close the lid firmly. Repeat this process six times within a span of 12 seconds.\nAfter completing the sequence, try setting the washer for a short cycle to see if it operates normally.\n\n\n\nRecalibrate the Washer\nIt is recommended to recalibrate your washer to reset it to its default/factory settings after installing new parts or after a major malfunction. The Whirlpool Cabrio washer is one of the models known to have a recalibration function, however, other Whirlpool washers typically follow the same procedure. You can always refer to your user manual for specific instructions for your model.\n\n\nUnplug the washer and wait 1-2 minutes before plugging it back in.\nEnter Diagnostic/Test Mode by rotating the dial clockwise (to the right) three clicks, then rotating it counterclockwise (to the left) one click, and finally rotating it clockwise again one click.\nAfter this sequence all the lights on the washer should turn on, indicating that you've successfully entered diagnostic mode.\nNext, enter Calibration Mode, by turning the dial clockwise 4 clicks, until only the “Rinse” light is illuminated\nPress the “Start” button to begin the calibration process. The washer will run through a series of tests, which may include filling with water, agitating, draining, and spinning.\nOnce the calibration process is complete, the washer should exit the diagnostic mode automatically, and you can use it as you normally would.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, just as with many modern appliances, Whirlpool washers can occasionally experience minor glitches or issues that disrupt their performance. Whether it's an unexpected error code, a machine that won't start, or irregular behaviour during a wash cycle, a simple reset can often serve as the first line of defence in troubleshooting. While resetting often rectifies minor issues, if your washer is experiencing consistent or recurring problems, there is likely a fault in the appliance that needs to be addressed. If you are in need of new parts, you can use our model search feature to find the right Whirlpool washer replacement parts for your model. Regular care and maintenance is important to keep your washer running smoothly for years to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Well don’t worry, LG dryer codes D80-D95 are only a warning, but one that you should take seriously. ‘D80’ is the first code you would normally see since it indicates that your dryer’s airflow is 80% restricted, and that there is the beginning of an underlying issue aside from some simple lint buildup. If you’re at an 80% restriction of airflow within your dryer, it’s a cause for concern. Something is causing that buildup, and it needs to be dealt with soon before it becomes a serious fire hazard. Luckily, we’ll tell you everything you need to know to fix it! \n\nWhat is LG Dryer Code D80?  \n\nError code D80 within LG dryers simply implies that 80% of the airflow within the dryer is restricted and will result in less efficient use of the dryer. It’s also an indication that even if you clean out the lint trap and the exhaust vent, there may be other areas within the exhaust vent system that a restriction is occurring. D80 is the first error code you will see before seeing codes, 'D90' and 'D95', which if seen would be a sign that the overall situation is worsening.  \n\nLG Dryer Error Codes D90 and D95  \n\nD90 and D95 are error codes that will appear indicating the exhaust system is getting worse and is now clogged approximately 90-95% and above, respectively. D90 and D95, as well as D80, are error codes that arise in LG dryers using the ‘Flow Sense’ system. This is a system using a sensor within the dryer’s exhaust vent to detect airflow restrictions to notify the user and prevent safety hazards from arising and causing catastrophe, such as a house fire. \n\n\n  \n  D80: Blockage of 80-90%; dryer will still function but will do so less efficiently and will take longer to dry completely. \n  D90: Clog of 90% or more; dryer will begin to 'cool down' and stop working to prevent any hazards from occurring. \n  D95: Airflow restriction 95% or above; dryer will 'cool down' immediately and stop working. \n  \n \n\nWhat is LG ‘Flow Sense’ and Why Does It Exist? \n\nOn the user-interface panel of certain LG dryers, there are various indicators of a ‘Flow Sense’ technology. This will be directly correlated to how restricted the airflow within your dryer is. This is done through a system with a pressure switch which measures the amount of air being blown at it, and a heat sensor that shuts off the dryer when the level of heat reaches dangerous levels. The more restricted the airflow and ventilation, the less air being blown.\n\nThis system exists to communicate to you how bad a buildup may be within the dryer's vent, before it's too late. Without this system, you could potentially use your dryer for a much longer amount of time before it either stops working properly or worse - catches on fire.\n\nNot every LG dryer’s user interface will appear to the same, but the image below is a general jist of what to expect for the ‘Flow Sense’ indicators. Your display may vary in location, size, and level of information available.\n\n SaveEmbed Image \n\nSource: LG Help Library\n\n\n\n2-4 bars on this gauge indicates that the system is severely restricted and the problem is worsening. If your dryer indicates ‘D80’ and has four full bars on the gauge, it will still operate, but those bars and the error code are a warning sign to inspect your dryer’s ventilation and clean it.  \n\n  \n\nDue to the type of warning this is, it’s imperative that you clean your dryer as soon as you see it. ‘Flow Sense’ is your dryer’s way of telling you to clean it, or at the very least inspect it, because there is an underlying issue like poor ventilation from built-up lint. Ignoring it will only make the situation worse and will lead to a severe fire hazard unless properly addressed.  \n\n  \n\nHow Do You Troubleshoot Error Code D80?  \n\n  \n\nThe first thing to tackle is simply cleaning your dryer - whether that's just vacuuming out easier areas or completely stripping parts from the appliance to clean harder to reach areas (i.e. the top panel, rear panel, front panel, etc.).  After you clean it, you can troubleshoot your LG dryer to test whether this issue lies with a component instead of the ‘Flow Sense’ system recognizing an issue. Proceeding with this troubleshooting may solve the issue with your dryer, especially if the error code is persistent and you don’t believe its ventilation is clogged. However, proceed with this at your own risk and make sure you give your dryer proper ventilation space, such as opening windows and doors, when doing so.  \n\n  \n\n\n \n  First, disconnect the dryer vent hose from the back of dryer.\n  Then add a load of wet clothes inside and run a cycle.\n  Let the cycle run and when it’s complete, check the clothes to see if they’re still wet, or if they dried.\n  If they’re dry then your problem is with the exhaust system of the dryer, but if they’re still wet then your issue may with the heating element or thermal fuse. Both of which are necessary for managing the internal temperature of the dryer and would need replacing if they're bad.\n \n\n\nDryer Exhausts 101  \nAlthough seemingly very complicated to some, dryer exhausts are straightforward. There are various materials and types of exhaust pipes and tubing you can configure, but these are recommended types of LG dryer exhaust system settings:\n\n \n  Galvanized metal or aluminum elbows and straight vent tubes, as opposed to the popular customizable tubes.\n  When joining these tubes, avoid using screws to fasten the tubes together since lint can get caught on the screws and build up quicker within the tube(s).\n  When you configure your personal dryer exhaust situation, it’s important to give the tubes ample room and not crush them. \n  Consider the space in relation to your dryer when planning how you want to vent your dryer, and where you need the tubes routed to (I.e. wall vent, ceiling vent, etc.).\n \n\n\nLint Filter and Exhaust Vent Cleaning\nThe most likely culprit of your dryer’s airflow issues are its lint trap, exhaust, and vent. All three can become extremely clogged with lint and will restrict the airflow significantly. The only way to relieve the pressure within your dryer’s exhaust system is to clean it thoroughly, using a vacuum, wire brush and air compressor (if you have access to one).\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nThe locations of your dryer’s ventilation issues will usually revolve around its exhaust where the tubing meets the dryer to vent lint and other debris outside, the lint trap where lint is designed to catch, and below the lint trap in the open chassis space of your dryer.\n  \n  \n\n\nIf you find your lint trap is broken or is allowing lint to slip through, it needs to be replaced immediately. You can find any compatible lint trap for your dryer throughout our wide range of dryer filters.\nIf you’ve cleaned those spots thoroughly and your dryer is still showing an error code, check to make sure the vent to the outside isn’t clogged and restricting airflow. Many homes have their vents on the side of the house, whereas others have it on the roof, so finding the exhaust vent is of utmost importance to making sure the air can flow freely . \n\nShould You Bypass Error Code D80?  \nWhen all else fails, there are ways to bypass error code D80 to get it out of your hair once and for all, but bypassing it is not without its own set of consequences. Once you deactivate the dryer’s system from notifying you of any airflow restrictions, it is important to remember that any underlying issues will only accelerate airflow restrictions if they arise again. This is why bypassing the system is not recommended unless you believe that it’s overly persistent.\nBypassing error code D80 is quite simple and only requires a few steps to accomplish:\n\n \n  Power the dryer on.\n  Press and hold both 'Time Dry' and 'Signal' buttons at the same time for 3 seconds.\n  After a few seconds the word, 'OFF' will appear in the display to indicate the operation as successful.\n  Now, the system that kept ‘D80’ has been deactivated.\n  Repeating these steps will produce the word, 'ON' in the display and will reverse this operation.\n  If your dryer does not display any message after attempting to deactivate the system, refer to your user manual for the appropriate button combination.\n \n  \n\n  \n\nWhy You Should Bypass a D80 Error Code  \n\n  \n\nIt is possible that your dryer is overly sensitive and is not properly detecting the level of airflow restriction appropriately. In cases where you as the user of the dryer have cleaned it, its exhaust and its vent – bypassing and deactivating the notification can be helpful. Technology can be buggy sometimes, and as the user you must occasionally take matters into your own hands to correct it.  \n\n  \n\nWhy You Shouldn’t Bypass a D80 Error Code  \n\n  \n\nThe argument to bypass your dryer’s system is unpopular and that's because it the ventilation is the issue - not the dryer. Lint can get stuck at any point during the ventilation process; inside the dryer itself, its exhaust, the ventilation tubes, and the exhaust vent leading outside. Many users will give up cleaning because of how many locations need to be inspected, however, lint that builds up will quickly become a huge safety issue if not properly addressed and cleaned.  \n\n  \n\nIn addition, choosing to ignore your dryer’s safety systems can become a safety hazard, because leaving the ventilation system unregulated can spell disaster even the smallest clog of lint exists. If you feel like you’ve properly cleaned it and are still receiving error messages, the best thing you can do before outright replacing your dryer, is contact an experienced technician to give you a second opinion.  \n\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n\n  \n\nConclusion: When To Call A Technician  \n\n  \n\nNo one wants to have to call a technician, but in a situation where your dryer simply is not working the way you want it to, it’s the best option. At this point, if you have exhausted all options and are perhaps facing other issues as well, it's recommend you get in touch with your local certified repair tech. However, this is a short list of housekeeping items to ensure your dryer is error code free:  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n  Clean your dryer’s lint trap after every use.\n  Clean the lint vent on the outside of your home every month.\n  Vacuum around, behind and under your dryer every month.\n  Clean the exhaust port on your dryer once every 3-6 months.\n  Remove the lint trap and vacuum inside of the dryer every 6 months.\n  Ensure the ventilation is not crushed and contains as few bends as possible to prevent lint buildup.\n  Test, repair, or replace parts such as the heating element, thermal fuse, and temperature sensors.\n \n \nEven though it may be more work than most people want to do, it can be very satisfying and reassuring to clean your dryer. And it's even more satisfying to not have the constant thought of your home burning down each time you use it! Now, clean that lint and get back to having warm and dry clothes!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Now is the time to start prepping it for sale! We’ve created a list of our top tasks to complete before your property hits the market. If you tackle a different project each weekend, you’ll be ready to go this spring with a show-ready home.\n\nMany regions across North America are experiencing a seller’s market – which means there are few listings, and many buyers looking for a home. You may experience receiving multiple offers, and your property may sell for over your asking price. Your home may not need expensive updates in order to sell, but it’s important for the property to look its best. If you’re also purchasing, you’ll want to get as much equity out of your current home as possible and our list of tasks can help.\n\nIf you live in an area with a balanced market or a buyer’s market, these tips are going to be extremely useful for you. A balanced market means there is a relatively equal number of people both selling and buying a house, whereas a buyer’s market means there are numerous listings competing for a small number of buyers. In these situations, it’s vital that your house stands out for all the right reasons!\n\n \n \n \n\n\nCurb Appeal\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nYou only have one chance to make a first impression, so make sure it counts! The exterior of your home is the first thing a potential buyer will see when they arrive for their showing, and the last thing they see as they’re leaving. You want to ensure that your yard, driveway, and walkways are in good condition for all visitors. Depending on where you live, winter conditions can linger well into spring, so if applicable make sure that any snow is shoveled, and pathways are well salted. If you have a front lawn, garden beds, or hedges, have them cleaned up and trimmed. Make sure any toys or lawn equipment are picked up and stored away. A fresh coat of paint on the door, and some potted flowers on the porch can do wonders to brighten up your entry way.\n\n\nDeclutter\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nAdequate storage is one feature that many homebuyers will be looking for. To determine if your home will fit their needs, they’re going to be inspecting the cupboards, drawers, and closest. To avoid embarrassment, or a potential avalanche tumbling out, it is vital that you declutter before listing your home for sale. Make sure you’re also keeping the kitchen and bathroom countertops clear. Small appliances or your daily skincare routine should be tucked away before a showing. If you have children or pets, keep a decorative basket handy to quickly gather toys in case of last-minute showing requests. Decluttering also offers an extra bonus to you, since you don’t have to pack up and move any of the items you purge or donate!\n\nDe-Personalize\n\nWhile you’re in decluttering mode, you should consider de-personalizing your living areas. The buyers will want to envision their family in the home, and neutral décor can help them achieve that. Carefully pack up and store personal items like family photos, wedding mementos, academic diplomas, and the fridge full of artwork. If you’re working from home, ensure that projects or documents are out of sight before a showing.\n\n\nSmall Updates\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIn today’s market, major renovations aren’t always necessary to sell a home. There are, however, some small updates that can refresh your space without breaking the bank. Replacing the hardware on your kitchen or bathroom cupboards can make a big impact with minimal effort. A slightly more ambitious option is also to replace the door handles throughout your home. Swapping out rounded knobs for a flat or lever handle not only looks more modern, but it also improves the accessibility of your home. Cleaning up or refinishing caulking and grout can also really brighten up bathrooms and flooring. An updated kitchen is on many buyers’ wish lists, but if a full reno isn’t in the budget you still have options. Painting or refinishing the cupboards, new hardware, and a modern faucet can freshen up the space and allow the buyers to see the potential for any further updates they may like to do.\n\n\nLight Fixtures\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nNew light fixtures are the easiest way to brighten up your home. Updating the light fixtures is a surprisingly simple and inexpensive change you can make, especially if your home is full of dated or builder-grade fixtures. Along with updating the light fixtures, swapping out light switches for rocker style switches is much more modern and again adds accessibility features. While you’re at it, swap out old bulbs in your light fixtures for LEDs - buyers love energy efficiency!\n  \n\nFresh Paint\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIt’s no secret that a fresh coat of paint is going to make the absolute biggest impact for the lowest cost. From your front door to the kitchen cupboards to the walls, the colors you choose will make a difference. When it comes to your walls, neutral is best. This gives every buyer viewing your home the opportunity to visualize their furniture and décor in the space. Thoughtful tip: leave the cans and paint chips when you move. If the buyer needs to do any touchups, they’ll appreciate the color matching. \n\nIf you’ve completed all the items on this list, congrats! Your home is looking its absolute best and will be the envy of the neighborhood. The work doesn’t stop here – make sure you’re keeping up with the cleaning and decluttering so that it stays show-ready!

Staring down an SY EF or 5Y EF code means there's a hiccup in the evaporation fan circuit. It is likely that there is something wrong with the fan motor, wiring, or the control board. Sometimes, a worn door seal or blocked air might cause the error.\n\nBut here's some good news: we've got a straightforward guide to help you understand and tackle the problem.\n\nWhat Does the SY EF / 5Y EF Error Mean on a Frigidaire Refrigerator?\nThese codes are short for 'System Evaporator Fault.' It will show up as 'Sy EF' or '5y EF' on the display. These codes might look slightly different because of how they appear on the screen, but they are the same error code!Your fridge has a team of parts that work together to keep things cold: there's an evaporator fan, a motor that powers this fan, some wiring, and the fridge's main control board. But if you see these codes light up, it's the fridge's way of saying something's not right with any of those parts.\n\nWhat Will You Notice With the SY/5Y EF Error?\nIf these codes flash up, your fridge has a few ways of letting you know it's not feeling chill:\n\n\nFridge Is Not Keeping Cold: Whether it's the fridge or freezer section, things just aren’t as chilly. Your ice cream's gone mushy, or your beverages aren’t refreshing anymore.\nIce Buildup on the Fan Blades: You could spot frost or even thick ice chunks forming around the fan area, making it harder for the fan to move freely.\nOdd Noises Coming from the Fridge: You might hear beeping, ticking, or grinding sounds you haven’t noticed before. The fan and the motor might chirp or squeal.\n\n\nWhat Is the SY/5Y EF Error Caused By? \nEvery problem has a cause, and this one's no different:\n\n\nEvaporator Fan Motor Issues: The fan motor is the heart of the fan. If it gets blocked, freezes up, or stops, the fan can’t circulate cold air around.\nCommunication Issues: The control board acts as the fridge's brain. If it can’t talk properly to the motor, things can go a little haywire.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Guide to Fix a SY/5Y EF Error on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nSafety Precautions\nBefore we get started with fixing things, make sure to unplug your fridge first. And pop on some gloves; they’ll help keep your hands safe from cuts or nicks while you're poking around inside.\nThings to Check\nSometimes, you can get rid of the SY EF error by fixing these common mistakes. Be sure you're not making these slip-ups:\n\nAre the Vents Clear? If you have food boxes blocking the vents, it can stop the cold air from moving around your fridge. Rearrange, organize, and remove some of the things that might be in the way.\nIs the Fridge Door Closing Properly? The gaskets, those rubber strips around the door edges, help keep it sealed. If they're damaged, warm air can sneak in. If yours looks worn or ripped, it might be time for a new one.\n\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Evaporator Fan to Fix a SY/5Y EF Error\nIf it’s time to bust out your handy toolbox, you will want to take a close look at your evaporator fan first. The evaporator fan circulates cold air within the refrigerator to keep everything evenly chilled and frost-free. If it malfunctions or is blocked, it can mess with the airflow, setting off that SY EF alert.\n\nHow to Inspect and Replace the Evaporator Fan on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nGrab your fridge manual for help on reaching the fan. For many Frigidaire fridges, the fan's behind the wall in the freezer. Begin by emptying out shelves, drawers, or baskets. It's often as easy as lifting and sliding them out. If there's a bar on rollers, remove it. If your fridge has an ice maker, unscrew it and unplug the connecting wires. Keep going until you reach the evaporator cover.\nBefore moving on, check the cover for ice, especially around any screw holes or vents. Ice here suggests there might be more behind. Don't force the cover off, as it could break. If there’s ice, let your fridge warm up for 48 hours or see if your manual tells you how to use the defrost setting. Place a towel at the bottom of the fridge for any melting water. If there's no ice, then go on and take off that cover. That's where you'll spot the fan.\nNow that you can see the fan, look for its wire connector and inspect it for any obvious wear and tear. If the fan is nestled inside a protective casing, remove the rings or brackets that might be holding it in place. The fan blades should be free and able to spin. If they’re blocked, broken, or icy, it's likely time for a replacement.\nIf a new fan is in order, fit it onto the motor’s shaft, then put everything back, starting with the evaporator cover and working your way out.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM evaporator fans.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Evaporator Fan Motor to Fix a SY/5Y EF Error\nIf the fan is in good shape, then its motor could be causing trouble. The motor powers the fan's rotation, and if it’s not working, the fan can’t do its job. This can make your fridge warm and cause the SY EF error.\n\nHow to Inspect the Evaporator Fan Motor on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nYou're already near the fan blades, so the motor is close by. Try spinning the fan with your hand. If it's hard to move, the motor might be the issue.\nTake off the blade and anything around the motor. Check the motor for any damage, like frayed wires or burn marks.\n\nHow to Test and Replace the Evaporator Fan Motor on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nYour fridge fan uses a 12-volt motor. To see if it's working, use a multimeter set to volts DC. Follow your fridge's manual to find the right terminals to test the fan motor. It should show 12 volts. If it's under 8 volts, the motor needs replacing.\nIf you're switching out the motor, take any mounts from your old motor and attach them to the new one. Fit the new motor in place, making sure it's held firm with its bracket. Slide the fan blade back and reconnect the wiring. After that, reassemble everything in order.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM evaporator fan motors.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Main Control Board to Fix a SY/5Y EF Error\nThe main control board is like the fridge's brain. It manages many tasks. If it can't communicate with parts like the fan, the SY EF error might show up because the fridge can't control temperatures properly.\n\nHow to Inspect the Main Control Board on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nIf your fridge has doors side-by-side, open both of them. If your freezer is on top, pull out the drawer. Remove the lower grill or kick plate from the base of the fridge.\nUse a big, flat screwdriver to gently push down and pull the board's cover forward. Remember how the wires are connected. Taking a picture with your phone can help you remember. Once you know how the wires go, unplug them. Then, remove the plug from the test port. After that, you can take out the old board.\n\nHow to Test and Replace the Main Control Board on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nWith your trusty multimeter, you can test the control board. Here’s a quick rundown of the wires on the board:\n\n\nBrown Wire: It's the common or ground wire. It ensures that electricity flows smoothly through the system and safely returns to the source, completing the circuit.\nBlue Wire: It tells the main board how fast the fan is spinning. If the fan's too fast or slow, the blue wire sends a signal to adjust it.\nYellow Wire: It controls the fan's speed. The control board can adjust the voltage on this wire to make the fan spin faster or slower.\nRed Wire: It supplies a steady 12 VDC, making sure all parts of the fridge have the power they need to work right.\n\n\nA working board will show 12 to 14 VDC between the brown and red wires on your multimeter. For brown to yellow and brown to blue, it should read 8 to 14 VDC.\nIf you're putting in a new board, slide it in and reconnect all the wires. Don’t forget to put the test port plug back! Slide everything back in place and clip the grille back.\nIf all this seems overwhelming, it might be time to call in a pro for some help.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM main control boards.\n\nPreventing Future SY/5Y EF Errors on a Frigidaire Refrigerator\nTo avoid the SY EF message popping up again, here's what you should do:\n\nMaintain Proper Ventilation\nYour fridge needs room to breathe, just like you! Check where the vents are on your fridge. They could be between the freezer and fridge sections or at the back. Make sure they aren't blocked, so cold air flows easily.\n\nInspect the Door Gaskets\nThe doors have soft rubber seals called gaskets. They keep the cold in when the doors are shut. Look to see they're clean and not damaged. If warm air sneaks in, the fridge has to work more, and you might get frost inside.\nTo remove a fridge door gasket, start at one corner and gently pull it away from its track, working your way around the door. If your new seal looks bent or twisted when you first take it out, soak it in warm water or use a hairdryer on a low setting to make it pliable. Once it's more flexible, install it in the door, making sure that it lies flat and seals well.\n\nDefrost the Freezer When Needed\nIf you see a lot of ice building up in the freezer, it's time for a defrost. Too much ice blocks the air and makes the fan work harder.\nCheck your user manual. Your fridge may have a special defrost setting, sometimes called “forced defrost”. On a few models, pressing the ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons at the same time for about 10 seconds will do the trick. This heats up the ice maker, freezer, and fresh food areas.\n\nAnd just like that, with a pinch of patience and a sprinkle of elbow grease, you've cracked the SY EF code! Here's to enjoying a fridge that's as cool and composed as you are.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

That’s okay, because you still have lots of time to fix the situation but if left for too long, your food will spoil. Frigidaire error code ‘HI’, commonly misinterpreted as ‘H1’, is a code that indicates a ‘high temperature’ within your refrigerator. Depending on the model of your refrigerator, you may hear an audible beeping noise when this error occurs, in addition to a visual code. This issue can be caused by a few parts, and can be fixed relatively easy, but depends completely on which part or issue is causing the higher than normal temperatures.\n\nWhat Is Frigidaire Refrigerator Code H1?\n\nError code H1 appears with Frigidaire refrigerator models when the temperature exceeds 26°F or -3.3°C in the freezer, and 55°F or 12.8°C within the refrigerator. Considering refrigerators should ideally remain between 35-38°F or 1.6-3.3°C and freezers should be on or around 0°F/-18°C, that’s making quite the jump, and should absolutely be a warning sign of something not working properly within your appliance.\n\nTo avoid spoiling your food, it’s best to first figure out whether your fridge, freezer, or both are being impacted by this high temperature issue. Try using a thermometer to test whether the internal temperature of both your freezer or refrigerator align with the set temperature setting. Put your hand in the back of the freezer to feel whether cool air is flowing, and check the vent in the fridge to check whether that cool air is moving over into the fridge as well.\n\nAlthough the issue is fairly simple to understand, its cause can be harder to grasp. Each appliance is different, meaning some of these parts may not be causing any issues whatsoever, but this is a list of which parts could be malfunctioning or defective and causing these abnormally high temperatures, in order of least to most elaborate:\n\n\n\nDirty Condenser Coils\nFridge Door Seal\nEvaporator Fan Damper\nDefrost Timer\nDefrost Thermostat\n\n\n\nFrigidaire Error Codes H and HI\nOne important aspect of this error code is that ‘H1’ is actually misrepresenting ‘HI’, which is consistently misread. In all fairness, however, because of the digital displays within these Frigidaire refrigerators, ‘H1’ and ‘HI’ would read the exact same. In addition, because many of the fridges displaying these codes have two separate displays for the fridge and freezer, it actually carries a different meaning. If you see H1/HI blinking on the display for the freezer, but not the fridge, the high temperature issue lies solely within the freezer - and the same applies for the fridge. If you see H1/HI blinking on both the display for the freezer and refrigerator, this temperature issue applies to both.\n\nHow To Troubleshoot Frigidaire Refrigerator Error Code H1\nThere are methods to not only finding out which part(s) is giving your refrigerator its H1 error, but there are also a few preliminary things you can do to potentially fix the H1/HI error outright.\nKeep The Door Shut\nFirst, Frigidaire’s own website describes the main cause for an HI error to be, “...by inadvertently not closing the door all the way or leaving the door open for an extended period of time.” so making sure your fridge doors are closed and sealed when the fridge is not in use is an obvious first step.\nEliminate Frost Build-Up\nEliminating any frost buildup around the door seal and within the fridge and freezers themselves will improve air circulation and keep the temperature much lower. Frost buildup usually occurs when moisture is captured into the freezer and can’t escape, and this can be eliminated by removing unnecessary food items or rearranging the storage of the food containers to improve air circulation. Without proper air circulation and cooling within the appliance, bacteria can fester and grow quicker, which is why eliminating any frost is extremely important. The following video will give you a general idea of how to eliminate this frost buildup in your refrigerator.\n  \n  \n\nTroubleshoot Individual Parts\nMany Frigidaire fridges come with an included troubleshooting guide with instructions to test each part individually. This feature isn’t available in every model, but you can normally locate this troubleshooting guide behind a kick plate at the bottom of the fridge, taped together in a small bag. By doing this, you can find out which part(s) are not working properly and gain a better grasp on the situation at hand. However, if your model does not have a guide included, you can be rest assured that following our guide will help you find the solution to this issue!\n\nHow To Inspect Frigidaire Fridge Condenser Coils to Fix an H1 Error\nCondenser coils are a set of tubes at the bottom of the back of your refrigerator. Those tubes are responsible for removing any heat from the refrigerant - which is a liquid that moves throughout the fridge and freezer - to keep your food cold. Sometimes, if the defrost system isn’t working properly or if the condenser coils are dirty and need cleaning, it can lead to frost building up on them, which can lead to improper cooling and will result in an H1/HI error code.\n\nTo prevent these coils from getting frost buildup, these are actions you can take to keep them working their best:\n\n\nClean condenser coils regularly: Lightly use a vacuum with a brush attachment to clean any dirt, dust and debris off them.\nCheck for leaks: If you notice any liquid leaks around them, contact a professional repair technician, since refrigerant is highly toxic.\nCheck the defrost system: Use your user manual to find and inspect the defrost system; ice or frost on the coils, or an empty drain pan underneath your fridge are signs that it’s not working.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nHow To Reset a Frigidaire Refrigerator to Solve H1 Error\nResetting your Frigidaire fridge may not completely solve whatever issue you’re having, in this case H1/HI/High Temperature, but if you have removed any frost buildup and made sure everything is working properly and the error code is still there, resetting it can resolve the error.\nDepending on your model, your user manual may have a specific button, or set of buttons that you need to press within the fridge itself, to fix the issue. If this is not the case, a hard reset can normally be done by disconnecting power from the fridge for 5-10 minutes and then reconnecting it.\nIf the error comes back in an audible or visual form, it means there’s still an issue that lies within your fridge that needs to be resolved. This can only be done by replacing whichever part(s) are not working properly or are broken.\n\nHow To Replace a Fridge Door Seal to Fix an H1 Error\nThe seal on your fridge door is integral to keeping the cool, climate-controlled environment of the fridge interior separate from the warmer room-temperature environment. Over time, through wear and tear, and incidental damage, fridge door seals can crack, grow mold or mildew, and become unserviceable. If the door seal stops working properly, the fridge will have a harder time cooling itself, leading to an H1 error code from the fridge. If this is the case for your fridge, you can order a new door seal from our wide range of Frigidaire door seals, and replace it by doing the following:\n\n\n\nCarefully pull the current door seal out of its groove.\nClean the groove and edge of the door thoroughly - disinfectant spray or soap and water are recommended for this.\nPlace the new door seal around the edge of the door and carefully work it into the groove.\nTest the seal by closing the door and inspecting for any bumps, ensuring it’s flush and completely sealed.\n\n\n\nHow To Replace a Frigidaire Fridge Damper to Fix an H1 Error\nThe fridge damper controls the airflow of cold air from the evaporator fan in the freezer, to the crisper drawer. The damper is controlled by the user’s control knob and when adjusted lower, it opens further to allow more cold air to flow into the fridge compartment. When the damper stops opening properly or is broken, it will cause temperatures to rise, leading to an H1/HI error, and will need to be replaced immediately. It’s worth inspecting the damper before replacing it, to see if there is a large frost buildup, and if there is, eliminating it to test whether that solves your H1/HI error.\nReplacing a fridge damper will require a replacement damper, which you can find in our variety of fridge parts, and can be removed and installed with the following guide:\n\n\nUnplug your fridge from the wall outlet.\nLocate the damper in the fridge - it’s usually located at the top of the freezer & fresh food compartments.\nDepending on your model, you may need to remove the food contents and containers within your fridge.\nRemove the screws that secure the damper with a Phillips-head screwdriver.\nDisconnect the wire harnesses securing the damper and remove it.\nYou can test the damper with a multimeter to see whether it has failed or if another part is the culprit.\nIf the damper is bad, you can now install it and its wire harnesses, then secure it with the appropriate screws.\nPlug your fridge back into the wall outlet and check to see if the damper works and if error code returns. You should feel cold air blowing from the vent of the damper into the fresh food compartment.\n\n\nThis is an example video and is not model specific, so your Frigidaire refrigerator may appear differently. \n  \n  \n\n\nHow To Replace a Frigidaire Defrost Timer to Solve an H1 Error\nThe defrost timer works with the thermostat to control the duration of the defrosting cycle and ensure the coils are always kept at the optimal temperature. If either the timer or thermostat fails, it will lead to frost buildup on the coils and heating issues within the refrigerator - which is the root of the H1/HI error.\nIf your defrost timer needs to be removed for inspection or replacement, you will need a screwdriver to access its panel, and a new defrost timer which you can find in our extensive range of OEM Frigidaire timers. Replacing this part also requires an easy repair guide, such as the following:\n\n\nDisconnect your fridge from the wall outlet.\nLocate the defrost timer either in the rear or ceiling of the fridge, or below it.\nUse your screwdriver to access the defrost timer’s panel and remove its wire harness.\nUnscrew the defrost timer and its wiring harness.\nYou can now test the timer with a multimeter to check for continuity. A beep on the multimeter means there’s continuity, and no beep or visual indication means it is bad.\nInstall the new defrost timer by screwing it in, and install its wiring harness.\nReconnect the defrost timer panel and install its wiring harness.\nReconnect the fridge to the wall outlet and test it to see if the H1/HI error code pops up.\n\n\n\nThis video is a general example of a Frigidaire refrigerator, so your model may appear differently.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nHow To Replace a Frigidaire Defrost Thermostat to Fix an H1 Error\nThe defrost thermostat is responsible for activating and deactivating the defrost heater to melt frost buildup on the evaporator coils. If it fails, frost will build up on the coils and lead to less heat being removed from the fridge interior and causing frost buildup in the freezer, resulting in the H1/HI error code.\nFirst, replacing the defrost thermostat will require a screwdriver, a wire stripper and crimper, two heat shrinking tubes, a heat gun, and a new defrost thermostat, which can be found in our comprehensive selection of OEM Frigidaire refrigerator thermostats. Removing and installing it can be done with the following step-by-step guide:\n\n\nDisconnect your fridge from the wall outlet.\nOpen the freezer compartment of your fridge and access the evaporator cover. This may require you to remove the shelves and contents of your freezer.\nRemove the screws securing the cover of the evaporator.\nLocate the thermostat at the rear of the evaporator assembly.\nCut the old thermostat wire and remove it.\nStrip a quarter-inch of the wire from the wiring harness and from the new thermostat.\nInsert the new thermostat wire leads and crimp the heat shrink tubing to each lead.\nCrimp the wire leads from the wire harness of the evaporator assembly to each of the wire leads of the thermostat.\nSecure the wires as they were originally, and resecure the evaporator assembly cover.\nConnect your fridge to the wall outlet and turn it on to see if the H1 error arrives.\n\n\n\nThis is a general video example, so your Frigidaire refrigerator may appear differently than that used in the video.\n\n  \n  \n \n\n\n\nConclusion: When Do You Call a Technician for an H1 Error?\nIf you have followed all of our repair guides and replaced every part that could be causing your refrigerator to have error code H1/HI - then your local, qualified repair technician is likely your next best option. No DIYer wants to call it quits, but there are some extremely stubborn appliances that will not work, no matter how much TLC you throw at it. Going forward, however, this is a list of important ways to keep your fridge in great health!\n\n\nClean the condenser coils once every year, or more, depending on how much hair, dust and debris is able to clog them.\nKeep your fridge’s interior clean and deep clean it at least once every few months to prevent the spread of bacteria.\nCheck the fridge, freezer, and condenser coils for frost buildup and eliminate it when you notice it. If it reappears, reference our guide again!\nMake sure the door seals are always working properly. If they stop sealing properly, remove any frost buildup you find, and then clean or replace them.\n\n\n\nA clean fridge is a healthy fridge, and a healthy fridge is a healthy person!

There are a system of error or fault codes which are used to alert users to potential problems or routine maintenance. Though these are two different brands, the F5 error code addresses the same issue, therefore you can use this troubleshooting guide to address both Maytag and Whirlpool washers.\nIf your Maytag or Whirlpool washer is displaying an F5 error code, there is no need to panic, it is relatively common, and it is letting you know there is a problem with locking mechanism of the washer. This step-by-step guide will help you understand the meaning of the code, identify the cause, and fix it yourself quickly and efficiently, regardless of the model or brand you own.\n\nWhat Does the Washer F5 Error Code Mean?\nThe F5 error code on a Whirlpool or Maytag washer is an indication that there is a problem with the washer's door or lid locking mechanism. The washer is designed to ensure the door is securely closed before beginning a cycle to avoid damage and potential injury. If the door or lid will not lock and/or the machine cannot detect that the door is locked, the F5 error will be displayed to alert you of this issue. \n\nFor both front-load and top-load washers, the F5 error code is displayed when the washer cannot detect that the door or lid is securely locked, or when the washer is having difficulty locking or unlocking the door/lid.\n\nF5 Error Sub-Codes: E1, E2, E3, E4\nThe F5 error code can be further divided into E1, E2, E3 and E4 codes which each refer to specific issues related to the locking mechanisms. These sub-codes offer more specificity about the error such as the part at fault. This allows you to troubleshoot with more accuracy and efficiency. Use the information below to learn more about these codes.\n\nWhat does the F5 E1 Error code mean?\nThe F5 E1 codes indicates that the door/lid either cannot lock or cannot unlock, most likely due to a problem with the door lock, lid switch or control panel.\n\nWhat does the F5 E2 error code mean?\nThe F5 E2 code shows that that the door or lid cannot lock due to blockage in the door latch or lid switch assembly.\n\nWhat does the F5 E3 error code mean?\nThe F5 E3 code indicates that the door or lid cannot not unlock, typically due to an issue with the with the door latch or the control board.\n\nWhat does the F5 E4 error code mean?\nThe F5 E4 code is a safety feature that indicates that the washer has run for several consecutive cycles without opening the door/lid. It communicates that the user must attend to the washer in between wash cycles.\n\nCommon Issues to Check When F5 Error is Displayed\n1. Is the Washer Door/Lid Closed Properly?\nThe F5 error will be displayed if the door is not shut completely. Inspect the door/lid area to see if there is any clothing item or object blocking the door.\n \n2. Is Your Washer Overloaded?\nThe F5 error can be displayed if the washer drum contains too many clothing items. Ensure that you are not going over the loading limit for your model.\n\n3. Is the Washer Experiencing a Glitch?\nIf the F5 error is caused by an electronic glitch or minor malfunction you can reset the washer to resolve the issue. You can reset the washer by unplugging it for 1-2 minutes, and then plugging it back in.\nAlternatively, you can clear the codes by pressing and holding the end of cycle button for 15 to 20 seconds. It is important to note that this option does not resolve the issue, it merely removes the error display.  It is recommended to follow the troubleshooting instructions before attempting this. \n\nF5 Error Code: Common Washer Parts to Inspect \nWhile the F5 error on both front-load and top-load washers indicates an issue with the washer's locking mechanism, the steps to troubleshoot vary slightly. Front-load washers are designed with doors that latch shut while top-load washers, use a lid lock mechanism. You can use the simple guide below to inspect the relevant parts for your washer and resolve the issue. If you're uncertain about any steps, it's best to consult with a professional or refer to the user manual. \nBefore beginning any repairs, ensure that the washing machine is disconnected from the power source and the water valves are shut off to ensure your safety. \n\nTroubleshooting the F5 Error on Front-Load Washers \n\n1. Door Strike\nThe strike is a small plastic component on the washer door that fits into the opening on the door latch and that keeps the washer door locked. If it is damaged or misaligned, the door may be unable to lock or unlock, resulting in the f5 error code.\nExplore our genuine OEM door strikes.\n\nHow to replace the door strike to fix an F5 error\n\n\nTo replace the door strike first remove the mounting screws that hold it in place. If the screws are stripped, or damaged, it is recommended to purchase new ones to keep the new strike securely held in place. \nOnce you have removed the faulty strike, you can now fit the new one in the empty space and install the screws. \nClose the washer door and check that the new strike is engaging with the door latch. \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. Door Latch\nThe door latch is found around the door opening, where it engages with the strike to keep the washer door closed. The latch may experience physical damage or electrical fault, leaving it unable to keep the door shut, and resulting in the F5 error. \nExplore our genuine OEM door latches.\n\nHow to replace the door latch to fix an F5 error\n\n\nOpen the washer door and peel the door boot off the washer frame.\n Undo the latch mounting screws and carefully remove the old door latch for inspection. If it is damaged, it will need to be replaced. \nIf the latch appears to be in good working condition, use a multimeter to test it for potential electrical failure. \nIf you find that the latch should be replaced, simply discard the old one and position the new one over the mounting holes. \nReconnect the wire harness and secure the new latch in place. \nRemember to return the door boot to the washer before closing the door to test that the latch is functional.\n\n\n\n3. Control Board\nIn both top-load and front-load washers, the control board allows you to control the various functions of the washer. If the control board is damaged or experiencing electrical failure, the locking mechanism on the washer may malfunction resulting in the F5 error. You can diagnose and resolve the issue by following these simple instructions.\nExplore our genuine OEM control boards.\n\nHow to replace the control board to fix an F5 error\n\n\nRemove the top panel of your machine to access the control board.\nLocate the control board inside the control panel and inspect it for physical damage or loose connections. \nTest the terminals of the board using a multimeter.\nMake note of or take an image of how the wires are routed and connected. \nIf the control board is no longer functioning carefully remove it from the panel and discard it. \nPlace the new control board inside the panel and use your notes to connect the wires to the appropriate terminals before securing it in place.\nReattach the top panel in your front-load washer or the control panel on your top-load washer to complete the repair.  \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nTroubleshooting the F5 Error on Top-Load Washers \n\n1. Lid Switch\nThe lid switch is a safety mechanism that detects whether the washer lid is securely shut and allows the wash cycle to begin. If the lid switch is faulty, the f5 error will be displayed and the washer may not start, spin, drain or stop appropriately. Do not attempt to bypass the lid switch mechanism as this increases the risk of damage to the washer and injury to the user.\nExplore our genuine OEM lid switches.\n\nHow to replace the lid switch to fix an F5 error\n\n\nDepending on your washer model you may need to remove the top panel in order to access the lid switch. It is recommended to use a putty knife and an extended shaft screwdriver to do so. \nDisconnect the wiring harness and inspect the switch for any physical damage. \nIt can be helpful to test the switch for continuity using a multimeter.  \nOnce you have established that the switch needs to be replaced, you can remove it from the washer and discard it. \nPlace the new switch on the underside of the cabinet and reattach the wiring harness. \nSecure the lid switch using the appropriate fasteners and return the top panel of the cabinet to the washer.\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. Lid Actuator\nThe lid actuator is an essential component of the locking mechanism, found under washer lid. When the lid is closed, the actuator activates the lid switch, which communicates with the control board that the door is securely shut. Over time the actuator may break or fall off, resulting in the F5 error. The actuator will need to be replaced if it is defective. \nExplore our genuine OEM lid actuators.\n\nHow to replace the lid actuator to fix an F5 error\n\n\nOpen the washer lid to access the lid actuator and remove the fasteners or locking tabs that hold it in place. \nCarefully remove the faulty actuator and discard it.\nAlign the new actuator with the mounting hole or locking tab and secure it in place to complete the replacement. \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n3. Control Board\n\nHow to replace the control board to fix an F5 error\nThe control board has the same function in both front-load and top-load washers. You can follow the instructions listed above to inspect and test the control board. However, on a top-load washer, you will need to first detach the control panel from the washing machine in order to access the control board. \nExplore our genuine OEM control Boards.\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nIt is important to address and resolve the F5 error code on your washer as the locking mechanism is vital for the safety and performance of the appliance. You can find replacement parts for your Whirlpool washer or Maytag washer right here! Whether you tackle the issue on your own or call in a professional, knowing the potential causes and solutions can help you understand your washer better and get the most out of it. \n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Steve first joined Eldis Group Partnership, PartSelect’s parent company, in 1975, starting with the humble job of shipping packages from the warehouse after completing an electronics course in trade school. In the 45-plus years of service that followed, he has worn many different hats with us, from warehouse-hand, to commercial service rep, service technician for both appliances and electronics, commercial sales rep, regional service manager, and most recently, video host and producer.\n\nFrom a young age, Steve knew that helping people solve problems with appliances and electronics around their homes was his calling. “I developed an interest in what made things tick,” he said. “I’d wake up in the middle of the night with solutions to problems and I couldn’t wait to get to work and put them into practice. There was always a fascination with the satisfaction of figuring things out and helping customers solve their problem.”\n\nSteve’s career saw him traveling far and wide, helping customers in their homes and teaching technicians in service schools to solve problems with appliances of varying scale and commercial complexity. So, when PartSelect proposed he step in front of a camera instead of an in-person customer or classroom in 2011, it felt like a natural fit. “It very quickly became comfortable to me,” he said. “I was used to talking anyway, and I was confident in what I had to say, and apparently I portrayed that quite well, because over the years it became clear that our customers felt the same way. I guess I was calm, confident, not flashy, and told people what they needed to know.”\n\nOver the coming decade Steve helped PartSelect produce thousands of videos that helped millions of viewers. What started as an experiment quickly proved itself to be a winning formula, as Steve’s calm and concise experience emboldened so many to carry out their own DIY repairs. “With the videos, I got the same feeling I used to get when leading service schools,” he said. “The feeling that people got something out of the effort we put into producing these videos.”\n\nPartSelect has watched as Steve’s approach and effort captured the hearts and trust of our customers, with our customer service representatives constantly fielding emails and phone calls singing his praises and thanking him for saving them time and money, and sometimes having some interesting follow-up questions of their own. “Every couple of months one of the call center representatives would tell me that someone had asked them if I was married,” laughed Steve.\n\nEnter Chris Boyle\nNot content to ride off into the sunset and leave the role of PartSelect video host in just anyone’s hands, Steve was conscious of helping our production team find the right replacement for his enormous boots. “I knew instinctively when I made my decision to retire, that there weren’t many people left with the skillset needed to do this video hosting still out there,” he said. “I really did care. I know the people who work here, I know the family that owns this company. It was my legacy, I didn’t want this to fall apart.”\n\nChris Boyle and Steve have a history that goes back to a friendship that was earned when Chris was a part of one of Steve’s service schools, way back in the late 1990s. Steve and Chris kept in touch over the decades that followed, and although their communication had become sporadic, Chris was always top of Steve’s mind as someone who could do this job, and do it well. “I took him out to lunch and I told him he’d be great at this. He had the experience. I was very confident in Chris. He has the same type of care for people, and is used to working with the public, and he knows what he’s talking about when working with appliances, lawn equipment, power tools, and more,” Steve said.\n\nAll that remained was the question mark about Chris’s comfortability on camera. “He came in and just nailed it,” Steve said. “We didn’t give him a script, we just told him what we wanted him to talk about, and he just nailed it. I didn’t even have to train this guy. We spent one week together on set and he’s been in the studio ever since. He knows his stuff, he’s always looking for new ways to do things, but he has that calm authoritative demeanor to him, because he knows what he’s doing. He’s not making things up. He’s been there.”\n\nChris knew the challenge he was up against in taking over from Steve from the start, and that there can only ever be one Steve. “It’s going to be tough filling his shoes,” Chris said. “He’s just so relaxed and smooth that he just makes it look so easy. Ever since I started moving into this role, I realized just how difficult it is and how easy he makes it look.”\n\nChris believes what he brings to the table is a lot of experience dealing with customers. “Very quickly in doing service calls, you learn to appreciate what a customer is going through, what they’re trying to accomplish, and from that, you learn to understand what the customer needs to hear and how to get it across,” he said. “Talking to the camera you don’t quite get the same body language or reaction, so you have to imagine what that would be like. I bring a lot of experience, a lot of diagnostic ability, and I’ve had my hands on a lot of products, and I’ve used them all. I can understand what it is the customer is trying to do and how to help them get through it.”\n\nDespite retiring, Steve’s never far away from a repair or DIY job. “I’ve already been doing some appliance repair in my retirement,” he said. “There’s always some repair projects to do around the house, and I’ve always been a person that can’t sit still for very long. There’s always got to be something to do.” You can take the man out of the workshop, but it’s much harder to take the workshop out of the man. The PartSelect team wants to wish Steve a heartfelt thank you for his four-and-a-half decades of service, his friendship, and his dedication to our mission to help our customers save time and money by completing their own DIY repairs.\n\nSteve's parting message for PartSelect viewers was one of gratitude. “I’m just so humbled by the feedback we’ve gotten from our customers all these years,” he said. “That they enjoyed what we did, and that we were able to help them, it made me very happy, it really did. I guess, in parting, I want to say to those customers to stay with us, because we’re going to continue to do that and more. I’m very confident that we’ve handed the reins to someone who is as capable or more capable than I have been in providing that help to you, and will continue to do so. Thank you all, for everything.”\nNo, thank you, Steve. And enjoy your retirement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

When the screen displays error codes, it indicates a specific problem within the range and offers you a reference point for troubleshooting. This allows you to identify the problem without needing extensive technical knowledge, so you can promptly and effectively resolve it.\n\nCooking dinner can already be a test of patience, but when your Whirlpool range flashes an F2 error code, it feels like the oven just handed you a pop quiz. Before you throw in the (dish)towel and order takeout, let's break down this error and find a fix.\nWhether you're new to DIY or an experienced pro, this guide will help you grasp the meaning of an F2 error code, identify the parts that need troubleshooting, learn how to repair them, and discover methods to prevent the code from coming up again in the future.\n\nWhat Is An F2 Error Code?\nWhen your range shows the F2 error, it typically points to a temperature-related issue. The oven's control board might detect an unusual resistance reading from the temperature sensor, or it could indicate that the internal temperature has exceeded a preset threshold. Your oven may feel too hot or too cold as a result.\n\nWhat Signs Should You Look For?\nThe error code might be accompanied by these telltale signs:\n\nYou hear constant beeping\nThe control panel shows incorrect oven settings\nThe oven struggles to reach or hold the intended temperature\nFood cooks or bakes unevenly due to temperature fluctuations\nFood overheats or burns\n\n\nWhich Parts Are Affected?\nBefore you start unscrewing panels and tinkering with wires, it is crucial to understand the components most likely at fault:\nControl Board\nActing as the range's \"brain,\" the control board oversees various oven functions, including cooking modes, temperature settings, and timers. In most cases, it resides behind the buttons and digital screen you interact with when setting your oven's temperature or cooking time. It looks like a small circuit board with a series of plug-in connectors where the different wires attach.\n\nTemperature Sensor or Thermistor\nAlso called the thermistor, the temperature sensor is the oven’s thermometer. It measures the temperature inside the oven cavity and sends this information to the oven's control board. If the temperature is too high or low, the board adjusts power to the heating element accordingly. The thermistor can look like a slender rod or probe and is often found protruding from the oven's back wall. The probe is a metallic or ceramic tip attached to wires.\n\nWiring or Connection Problems\nIf the control board is the oven's \"brain\", the wiring in the temperature regulation system are the \"nerves\". The wiring is a set of colored insulated wires that run from the control board to the temperature sensor and to the heating element. They are crucial for relaying temperature data, allowing the sensor to send readings to the control board so it can adjust the heating and cooking temperatures. They are often bundled together and held in place with clips or ties.\n\nHeating Element\nResponsible for heating the oven and the actual cooking process; it is usually a coil or a flat piece of metal that sits at the bottom of the oven. When you set the oven to bake or broil, it glows red-hot when electricity passes through it.\n\nPossible Causes of the F2 Error Code\nKnowing why these issues occur in the first place can help you prevent future ones:\n\nNormal wear and tear: Components like sensors and wiring degrade over time with regular use.\nHigh temperatures: Sensitive components may deteriorate when exposed to excessive heat.\nElectrical surges: Sudden voltage spikes from lightning strikes or power outages can overwhelm the range's control system, damaging components or altering their resistance.\nMoisture and humidity: High humidity levels can lead to condensation. Moisture build-up within the range can disrupt electrical pathways, leading to short circuits or irregular behavior.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide\nReady to roll up your sleeves and tackle this error code? Grab your tools and let's dive in!\nTools Needed to Fix the F2 Error Code\n\nScrewdrivers (for removing panels and accessing components)\nMultimeter (for testing the resistance or voltage of the components)\nPliers (for working with wiring and connections)\nReplacement parts (if needed)\n\n\nSafety Precautions\nAlways remember to switch off the range at the circuit breaker unless you're using your multimeter to check voltage. Then, give the range enough time to cool down. It's advisable to wear cut-resistant gloves, especially when dealing with sharp parts. Keep your user manual close at hand, as component locations can vary by model.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Control Board\nAfter turning off the range at the circuit breaker, wait a few minutes before powering it back on; this is known as power cycling and helps reset the range's internal electronics. Sometimes, this is enough to clear the error code.\nIf this doesn't work, move on to testing the control board. Find it directly behind the control panel and inspect for visible issues like burn marks. Be cautious not to touch wires or components with your bare hands.\nWith a multimeter, you can test the board's voltage. Refer to your user manual to locate the power input connector and wires on the board. Set the meter to the voltage (volts AC) mode and attach the probes to the board's input terminals. A display around 120 volts is expected.\nTo replace a faulty board, remember to first unplug the power cord. Note the wire connections on the board before disconnecting them (taking a picture can help!). Remove the old board and install the new one by securing it in place and reconnecting its wires.\n\n\nExplore our genuine OEM control boards.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Temperature Sensor or Thermistor\nIf the control board is in working condition, your next suspect should be the temperature sensor, especially if the error code appears exclusively during cook and clean modes.\nConsult your user guide to locate it—it’s typically in the rear panel of the oven. Access it by removing the screws on each side and gently raising and lowering the panel to reach the sensor. Disconnect the wire harness connector by pressing down on its tab. Check for corrosion or rust on the sensor's terminals.\nWhen testing the sensor, ensure the oven has cooled to avoid affecting the multimeter reading. Set the multimeter to the resistance setting, then touch a terminal with each probe. If the reading deviates significantly from 1100 ohms at room temperature or shows no resistance, it is time to replace the sensor. If you suspect that it has shorted through the frame of the oven, conduct a continuity test from each terminal to the oven's metal body. If there's resistance, the sensor is shorted.\nTo replace the old sensor, unthread its mounting screws and free it from its opening. Install the new sensor by reconnecting it to the wiring harness. Finish the repair by reassembling the oven.\n\n\nExplore our genuine OEM temperature sensors.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Wiring Connections\nIf the error persists, take a close look at all the wires connected to the control board, thermistor, and heating element. Examine the bake or broil relays for welded relay contacts. These look like two metal points that have melted or stuck together, instead of maintaining a small gap between them—if found, you will need to replace the control board.\nMake sure the wires are not damaged or burnt. Tighten any loose connections you come across. Test the wires for continuity with your multimeter; it should either beep or show a value close to zero ohms. Replace any wires that fail the test. \n\n\n Explore our genuine OEM wire connectors.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Heating Element\nWhen all else fails, consider checking the heating element. Remove the access panel specific to it, disconnect the wires from the element's terminals, and remove the oven racks. Take out any mounting screws holding the element to the interior panel. You can remove the old element from the oven and check it for signs like breaks, discoloration, or arcing. Make sure that the sensor is positioned centrally and isn't touching the sides of its hole or the oven interior, as that can lead to inaccurate readings.\nIf you're still uncertain, turn to your trusty multimeter. For analog models, set the range dial to the lowest ohms setting and calibrate the meter to zero. For digital models, use the lowest ohms setting or \"resistance with tone,\" if available. A reading between zero and fifty ohms indicates continuity; otherwise, the element is likely burnt out.\nTo install the new element, insert its terminals through the rear panel slot and secure it with screws.\n\n\n Explore our genuine OEM heating elements.\n\nPreventing Future F2 Error Codes\nJust like a soufflé, your oven loves tender care! Regular maintenance is the key to avoiding annoying error codes.\nMake it a habit to clean your oven and its parts regularly to stave off dust and debris buildup, which can affect temperature accuracy. For large families, consider cleaning your range once a month. Otherwise, a quarterly deep clean should suffice. It's not rocket science either—promise! All you need are cleaners, cleaning gloves, microfiber cloth rags, and a sponge: \n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\nHere are other little maintenance tips that go a long way:\n\nUse the Oven Properly: Avoid slamming the oven door, as this can damage nearby components.\nUse Oven Liners: Consider using oven liners or aluminum foil to catch spills and keep them from reaching sensitive parts. Just be sure not to block any vents or fans.\nAvoid Overusing the Self-Cleaning Feature: Be careful when using the self-cleaning feature; reserve it for when needed as it can stress oven components.\nAvoid Overheating: Refrain from running the oven at excessively high temperatures for prolonged periods, as this can result in component wear and tear.\n\n\nThe next time your Whirlpool range throws an F2 error code your way, don't let it throw a wrench in your dinner plans. Remember, a simple error code doesn't have to be a recipe for disaster – just a minor hiccup in your culinary journey.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Alternatively, you can continue reading for our written guide on understanding the F21, F02, and F9E1 error codes, the associated symptoms, and DIY fixes to get your washer back in working order.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nWhat Do the F21, F02, and F9E1 Codes Mean?\nEssentially, these error codes are your washer's way of saying there's a drainage problem, and it's taking longer than usual to empty the water from its drum. In this guide, we'll walk you through troubleshooting for all three error codes: \n\nF2 Error: This suggests a minor blockage, causing a slight delay in draining water from the drum.\nF02 Error: It's a more severe drainage problem, indicating your washer couldn't drain water within its usual 8-minute limit.\nF9E1 Error: It is likely that there is a malfunction within the drainage system, potentially preventing your washer from draining at all.\n\n\nBased on the error code, your next steps may involve cleaning filters or hoses for F21 and F02 issues or considering a parts replacement or seeking professional assistance for F9E1 problems.\nStill confused about the differences between the codes? Let’s break it down using a kitchen sink analogy:\n\n\nF21 Error: Imagine you're washing your breakfast dishes, but the water in the sink is draining slowly. Your sink seems to be murmuring, \"Hey, maybe there's some food slowing down the water flow?\" That's like an F21 error—your washer can still drain the water, but it's slower than it should be.\nF02 Error: Fast forward to lunchtime. You set a timer for 8 minutes so you won't forget about your boiling pasta on the stove. You notice the sink is still draining, but very, very slowly. When the timer buzzes, you know you've got a problem—just like an F02 error on your washer. Your washer is saying, \"I had 8 minutes to drain, and I didn't. This is serious!\" In technical terms, your washer couldn't drain within its programmed time limit, which is usually set at 8 minutes.\nF9E1 Error: Evening rolls around, and as you try to drain the sink after dinner, there's a strange gurgling sound and a not-so-pleasant smell. That's the F9E1 error—there is not just a draining issue but a potential malfunction of the drainage system itself, which might need expert help.\n\n\nWhat Symptoms Can You Expect?\nWhen your washer encounters any of these error codes, keep an eye out for the following signs:\n\nProlonged Cycles: You may notice that its cycle timings extend far beyond what’s normal. When your washer is struggling to drain, it causes a domino effect that delays subsequent cycles like rinsing and spinning. Your washer may even attempt to drain multiple times.\nPaused Machine: Your washer might come to a halt, displaying the F21 error code and effectively pausing the entire machine.\nWater Left in the Drum: After a cycle, you might discover that there's still water left in the drum.\n\n\nPossible Causes of the F21, F02, and F9E1 Codes\nKnowing which parts to side-eye can really save you some troubleshooting time. Here are the likely culprits:\n\nDrain Filter: This is usually the first place to check. It's a protective mesh that catches small items like lint, coins, or buttons. A clogged filter slows down the draining process.\nDrain Pump: The pump’s job is to push the used water out of the washer and into the drain hose. Occasionally, small objects can get lodged in the pump, causing it to become congested.\nDrain Hose: This hose carries the dirty water out of your machine and into your home's drainage system. A blockage or kink in the hose will impede proper drainage.\nPressure Switch: This component monitors the water level inside the drum. If it malfunctions, it can send incorrect information to the control system, complicating the draining process.\n\nWith this groundwork, you're primed for the hands-on phase of this repair journey.\n\nTroubleshooting Guide for Whirlpool and Maytag Washers\nNow that you've gotten a sense of what to look out for and what parts could be the problem-makers, you’re probably itching to get that error cleared.\n\nThings to Check First\nBefore grabbing your toolbox, consider this quick checklist of simple things you might have overlooked:\n\nIs Your Washer Overloaded? An overcrowded washer can disrupt water circulation, affecting drainage. There should be enough space in the drum for you to insert your hand along with the laundry comfortably.\nAre You Using High-Efficiency (HE) Detergent Properly? Excessive suds, often caused by using the wrong detergent or using too much of it, can lead to drainage issues. Double-check that you're using HE detergent and sticking to the manufacturer's recommended amount.\n\n\nSafety Precautions\nRemember to unplug your washer from its power outlet and to turn off the water supply before disassembling any parts. Keep a few towels close by as they'll come in handy for soaking up any spills. After all, it’s better to be safe than soggy. \n\nHow to Drain Water from Your Whirlpool or Maytag Washer\nShall we address that elephant in the room— er, drum? If there’s standing water in your washer, it isn’t going to disappear on its own!\n\nUsing the Drain and Spin Cycle\nIf your washer has a “Drain and Spin” cycle, great! Activate it to get rid of any leftover water resulting from a stopped or incomplete cycle.\n\nDraining Residual Water Manually\nIf your washer doesn't have a \"Drain and Spin\" feature, don't sweat it. Start by locating your washer's drain pump filter. The location can vary by model, but it's usually found either behind a rear panel or inside a small compartment at the bottom of the machine. To find out for sure, check your user manual.\nPlace a container under the drain pump to catch the water that will come out. Carefully unscrew the filter cap to let the water drain into the container. Some washers also have a hose next to the filter; if yours does, you can unclip it, open its plug, and allow any trapped water to drain out. If your container fills up before you're done, just screw the cap back on, empty the bucket, and continue draining.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drain Pump and Filter to Fix an F21, F02, or F9E1 Error Code\nLet's figure out if that error code you're seeing can be cleared by giving the drain pump and filter a once-over.\n\nHow to Inspect the Drain Pump and Filter\nDepending on your Whirlpool or Maytag washer model, the drain pump and filter are typically located either at the back, concealed by a panel, or at the bottom front inside a drawer. Your user manual will show you where to look.\n\nIf the pump is at the back of your washer, you'll usually need to remove some screws to take off a rear panel to reach it. Don't forget to also disconnect the inlet and outlet hoses by loosening their clamps. Pro tip: Sliding the washer away from the wall and propping the front end up with some blocks can make this process a lot easier.\n\nIf the pump and filter are inside a drawer at the bottom front, open the drawer using its handle. To remove the drawer completely, you may have to press down on a tab on its right side while lifting another tab on its left side.\n\nIn either case, you will want to disconnect the pump’s wiring harness before uninstalling it from the machine. Take off any screws or clamps holding it in place. To see inside the pump, use an adjustable wrench to twist and remove the filter cap.\n\nHow to Clean Drain Pump and Filter\nChances are, you've got some lint, hair, loose change, or even socks clogging up the filter. After removing the cap, clear large debris by hand and rinse it under running water to remove remaining dirt.\n\nHow to Install the Drain Pump and Filter\nOnce everything's clean, reconnect the electrical wiring to the pump and slide it back into place. Secure it using any screws you removed earlier. Turn the filter cap until it's tightly in place; the handle should be basically standing up vertically. Finally, put back and secure either the drawer or the rear panel.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM drain pumps and pump filters.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drain Hose to Fix an F21, F02, or F9E1 Error Code\nIf the error code persists after checking the drain pump and filter, your next course of action is to examine the drain hose.\n\nHow to Inspect the Drain Hose\nThe drain hose generally runs from the back of your washing machine to a standpipe. To take a closer look, unclamp and remove the hose from both the washer and the standpipe. Feel along the hose for any kinks or twists that might be blocking the flow of water. If you find any irregularities, a replacement may be in order.\n\nHow to Clean the Drain Hose\n\nFor minor blockages: A burst of compressed air can often do the trick. Blow air through the hose to dislodge any minor clogs.\nFor tougher clogs: Use a plumbing snake or a stiff wire. If your hose has a special clip to help it keep its shape, remove that first. Insert your snake or wire into the hose, moving it back and forth until you feel the blockage give way. If your hose has a bent section or \"elbow,\" it's best to start from that end.\n\nSome hoses have a built-in valve that prevents water from flowing backward. If that's the case, make sure you're inserting your snake or wire in the same direction the water flows. Otherwise, the wire will get stuck against the valve.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Install the Drain Hose\nWhen you're installing a new or freshly-cleaned hose, gently insert it into the standpipe, ensuring it doesn't extend more than 4.5 inches into the standpipe. Secure the hose in place, but avoid tightening it to the extent that it restricts airflow around the hose.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nSource: Whirlpool Product Help Library\n\nThe end of your drain hose should be positioned at a minimum height of 36 inches above the floor to prevent any unwanted siphoning issues. Conversely, if the hose extends higher than 96 inches, you'll want to lower it slightly to ensure optimal performance. Remember to never tape over the standpipe's drain opening.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM drain hoses.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Pressure Switch to Fix an F21, F02, or F9E1 Error Code\nIf all else fails, the last place to check for issues is the pressure switch.\n\nHow to Inspect the Pressure Switch\nYou'll usually find the pressure switch under the top cover of your washing machine. Once you've got that open, take a look at the switch. Look for obvious problems like cracks or corrosion. Also, make sure the wires connected to it are in good shape and securely attached. Loose or damaged wires can often be the reason a pressure switch isn't working correctly.\n\nIf you think the switch needs to be removed for further inspection, use a flat screwdriver to undo any clips or fasteners holding it in place. Remove it along with the clear tube attached to it—this tube helps the switch detect air pressure.\n\nHow to Test the Pressure Switch\nYou can test the pressure switch using a multimeter. But first, gently blow into the tube connected to the switch. You should hear a 'click' sound, which means the switch can sense changes in air pressure.\n\nThen, set your multimeter on continuity mode. Connect the meter's probes to the switch's terminals and see if the meter registers a change when you blow into the tube again. If the readings don't change, your pressure switch is likely faulty.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Install the Pressure Switch\nIf the old switch is bad, you'll need to install a new one. Connect the wire and tube to the new switch and put it back where the old one was. Once it's in place, reattach the top cover and secure it.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM pressure switches.\n\nHow to Prevent an F21, F02, or F9E1 Code\nThese practical tips will keep your Whirlpool or Maytag washer from running into drainage problems:\n\nMonitor the Drain Hose Regularly: Ensure that the drain hose is positioned in a way that allows for unobstructed water flow. Check its placement and condition periodically.\nCheck the Pump Filter Regularly: Make it a routine to clean the drain pump filter at least every three months. A clean filter ensures smooth water drainage.\nCheck Pockets While Loading the Washer: Small items like coins, hairpins, or tissues can create clogs in the drain system. Always make it a point to check the pockets of your clothing before tossing them into the washing machine.\nUse Proper Detergent: Opt for an HE detergent and use it in the correct amount to prevent excessive suds that could interfere with draining. It's worth noting that not all HE detergents are created equal in their ability to minimize suds. If you continue to experience issues, consider switching to a different HE detergent. Always adhere to the detergent manufacturer's guidelines for the proper amount to use.\n\n\nNow that you’ve tackled that error code, you’re no longer just a homeowner but a home fixer. So go ahead, load up that washer and get back to the important stuff, like deciding if your laundry should smell like 'Citrus Sunburst' or 'Spring Bliss'.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

The 'PF' error code is a clear indication that there was a power failure which caused your microwave to turn off. However, what's not clear is what exactly caused your GE microwave's power to fail. The following guide will help you to not only figure out what could be causing power failure issues within your GE microwave, but how to fix it!\n\nWhat is the GE Microwave PF Code?\nNormally, your GE microwave will display a 'PF' error code if your home experiences a power outage, and turns back on after the outage is over. When you see this error code pop-up or flash on the screen, you can usually just dismiss it by pressing the 'CLEAR' or 'OFF' button on the touchpad - and that's that! But sometimes a 'PF' error can be a sign of another issue for your microwave, such as the power outlet that it's plugged into, as well as issues with the microwave's fuse or control board.\n\nGE Microwave Codes PF, 888, or 8888\nDepending on your GE microwave model, you will either see a 'PF', '888' or '8888' error code - these all carry the same meaning but can all be dismissed and cleared by simply pressing 'CLEAR' or 'OFF' on the control panel touchpad. However, if this error code persistently appears on your microwave, there may be something else wrong, or a part that you need to replace.\n\nWhat if GE Microwave PF Error Won’t Clear?\nIf your microwave still won't start after receiving a PF, 888, or 8888 error code, and the error code won't clear by using the above methods, there is likely a part within your microwave or the outlet it's connected to that isn't working properly and causing the electrical current to not travel consistently. Users who have noticed such error code have also experienced their microwave reaching very hot temperatures, and emitting a hot smell after use. The following items (in no specific order) are actions you can take now to get a better grasp of your microwave's power failure situation, and potentially fix it:\n\n\n\nInspect Your Fuse Box: The fuse box within your home is commonly located within the garage, but may be in another room within your home. When checking your fuse box, exercise utmost caution, due to the high voltages of electricity within. Check whether any fuses are turned off, and turn them back on if necessary to your microwave's operation. If you notice any blown fuses, that normally appear as black or melted, replace them immediately by turning off power to the fuse box, and then using a screwdriver to carefully remove the old fuse and install the new one.\nCheck Microwave's Outlet and Power Cable: Using a non-contact voltage tester, check the wall outlet of the microwave to see whether it's fully operational and/or loose. A loose wall outlet not only impacts your microwave's power supply, but also poses a potential fire hazard and must be replaced immediately. As well, use a voltage tester to inspect whether the power cable of your microwave carries a current while it's plugged in. If it doesn't, it's recommended that you contact a professional technician to replace the cable, or replace the microwave outright.\nBroken Door Switch: A broken or non-working door switch within your microwave may cause your microwave to stop intermittently, and without warning. A broken door switch will also allow microwaves to escape from the interior, which results in the exterior of the appliance becoming hot and producing a burning smell. If your door switch needs to be replaced, you can read the guide below to assist in the process.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Microwave Door Switch\nReplacing a door switch on your microwave is not only important to the convenience of using the appliance, but its safety as well. If your microwave's door switch needs replacing, you can find a compatible GE microwave door switch on our PartSelect inventory, and a general replacement guide below:\n\n\n\nUnplug your microwave.\nUse a screwdriver to remove the grill from the top of the microwave.\nOnce the grill is disconnected, remove it from the microwave.\nUse a screwdriver to unthread any screws blocking access to the control panel.\nLift the control panel to dislodge it, and carefully pull it away from the appliance.\nUnthread and disconnect the switch assembly.\nDepress the securing tab of the switch, and disconnect its wire connector.\nInstall the new door switch to the wire connectors and securing tab.\nRethread the switch assembly.\nInstall the control panel and secure it with screws.\nReinstall the grill of the microwave.\nReconnect the microwave to power, and test the switch.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a GE Microwave Fuse\nA microwave's fuse is a small glass tube that protects it from any short circuits or power surges, which can arise during power outages. If you notice your microwave is no longer powering on after a power outage, or displays a PF, 888, or 8888 error code and turns off when in use, the fuse may be blown and in need of replacement. Not only can you find an OEM GE microwave fuse on our part site, but you can read our general guide below to assist in your fuse removal and installation process:\n\n\nDisconnect your microwave from the wall outlet.\nOpen your microwave door and remove the screws securing the top grill/panel of the microwave.\nRemove the screws securing the front control panel touchpad.\nLift the control panel and pull it away from the microwave to access the inner components.\nLocate the fuse and use a screwdriver to carefully gain access to it. Your fuse will most likely be located above the control panel.\nUse a set of pliers to carefully remove the fuse, so you can inspect it and/or replace it. Check for any signs of damage, such as corrosion or melting.\nInstall the new fuse in place, and check the internal wires for corrosion or burns.\nReassemble and reseat the inner control panel portion of the microwave, and reinstall it.\nRethread the securing screws of the control panel touchpad and the top of the microwave.\nReconnect your microwave to the wall outlet and test it.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace a GE Microwave Control Panel\nThe control panel in a microwave is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the microwave's power level and temperature, as well as making sure the microwave shuts off when it's unsafe to operate. GE microwave users will see PF, 888, or 8888 error codes after their microwave has lost power, or if the control panel has failed due to a power surge or short circuit. If your control panel persistently produces error codes, it or its circuit board will need replacing immediately. Not only can you find genuine OEM GE microwave circuit boards and control panels in our parts inventory, but you can read the following guide for a general removal and installation overview:\n\n\nUnplug your GE microwave.\nUnthread and remove screws securing the top grille.\nOpen the microwave and remove the grille.\nUnthread any screws securing/mounting the control panel.\nDetach the control panel.\nPull the control panel away from the microwave and disconnect it.\nDisconnect the cables from the control panel to the microwave, and ensure you know their positions for the installation later.\nUnscrew or unclasp the main circuit board within the control panel.\nRemove the circuit board.\nWith a multimeter, you can now test the circuit board's terminals to determine whether it has continuity, and you can check the control panel visually for any signs of damage.\nTo replace the assembly, install the circuit board inside the control panel housing and secure it with screws or clasps.\nInstall the control panel and the appropriate cables.\nSecure and mount the control panel to the microwave.\nReinstall the grille.\nPlug your microwave in and test it.\n\n\n\nWhen to Replace a GE Microwave\nAt this point, if you're not able to get your microwave working properly, there may be an issue even more involved, and when dealing with microwaves, big issues are quite complicated and hazardous, even for veteran repair-people. So whether you end up getting a new microwave or have a fixed one, hopefully it's working all in one piece and you're able to avoid any power-issue error codes! To stay safe in the future, here are some easy tips and tricks for your GE microwave:\n\n\n\nOpen The Door Carefully: To avoid blowing a fuse issues in your microwave, ensure you open its door carefully to avoid blowing the internal fuse.\nClean It Regularly: Just like any appliance, keeping your microwave clean will keep your food tasting good, and your home from any hazards.\nReplace Parts: No appliance works well with broken parts, even if it's just a lightbulb that's burnt out. Always replace its broken parts, and find them on PartSelect!\n\n\n\nFor any and all other appliance error codes or home improvement guides, make sure to stay tuned to our PartSelect blog!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Just when you think you could tick 'laundry' off your to-do list, your machine flashes codes like ‘5d’, ‘Sd’, or ‘Sud’ on the display screen. What’s going on?\nThese codes mean your washer is dealing with a suds problem, often caused by using the wrong detergent, overloading, or a blocked drain. We're here to guide you through fixing these issues step by step, so you can get your laundry day back on track!\n\nWhat Does the 5d/Sd/Sud Code Mean on a Whirlpool Washer?\nCan't make heads or tails of the '5d,' 'Sd,' or 'Sud' messages on your washer's display? These codes are saying that there's too many suds inside the machine, making it hard for it to drain water properly.\nWhen your washer displays these codes, it pauses the cycle, adds more water, and makes the rinse time longer to dissolve those extra bubbles. You might see this process repeat a couple of times until all excess bubbles are gone.\nWhile your washer tries to fix the problem automatically, letting it happen too often can lead to increased energy consumption, and even wear and tear on the machine. It's like putting a temporary Band-Aid on the problem without addressing its root cause.\nOh, and one more thing: 'Sd' and '5d' might look alike because of the screen's font, but they mean the same thing.\n\nCommon Causes of the 5d/Sd/Sud Code\nHere are the usual causes of those bubbly error codes:\n\nToo Much Detergent: High-efficiency (HE) washers are designed to work with less soap. Using more than the recommended amount can lead to overflowing suds.\nWrong Type of Detergent: High-efficiency detergent is formulated to produce fewer suds. Using non-HE detergent in an HE machine is like putting diesel in a gasoline engine; it's simply not compatible.\nDrainage Problems: Blocked or kinked drain hoses can cause suds to accumulate as the water doesn’t drain properly. This backs up the system.\nFaulty Pressure Switch: The pressure switch checks water levels. If it acts up, it may wrongly think there are extra suds.\n\n\nTroubleshooting and Fixing the 5d/Sd/Sud Code\nNo DIY background? No problem! We're breaking down '5d,' 'Sd,' and 'Sud' code fixes for anyone to follow:\n\nThings to Check\nFirst things first, let's run through the basics and see what you should be checking when those codes pop up:\n\nIs the Washer Overloaded? Make sure you're not asking your washer to carry more than it can handle. When the laundry isn't spread evenly, it can upset the washer's balance and drainage, which might lead to extra suds.\nIs Your Water Causing Suds? Sometimes, if your water has lots of minerals (like hard water), it can create too many suds. You can fix this by using water softeners or filters.\nAre You Using the Right Detergent? Check that you're using the right amount of HE detergent recommended for your machine.\nDid You Use Special Liquid Bleach? Be careful with some types of liquid chlorine bleach labeled as \"no splash\" or \"easy pour.\" They can cause too many suds. If that's the case, go for regular liquid bleach instead.\n\n\nSafety Precautions\nBefore making any repairs, your safety comes first. Please make sure to unplug your washer and turn off its water supply.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drain Hose to Fix a 5d/Sd/Sud Code\nThe drain hose carries away the water used during a wash cycle. You'll spot it attached to the back of your washer. One end connects to your washing machine, while the other end sends water into a drainpipe or laundry drum.\n\nIf the hose gets clogged, water can't leave the drum efficiently and suds will start to build up. That's when the error codes show up.\n\nHow to Inspect the Drain Hose on a Whirlpool Washer\nTo check your washer's drain hose, gently move the machine away from the wall to access the back. There, you'll find the drain hose, which is usually a thick, flexible tube. Some washers use hose clamps to secure it, while others have spring clamps. If there's a hose clamp, use a screwdriver or pliers to loosen it, and if it's a spring clamp, squeeze and slide it down to release the hose.\n\nCarefully remove the drain hose, keeping in mind there might be some residual water. Run your hand along the hose, feeling for kinks or sharp bends, and straighten them out for proper water flow.\n\nHow to Clean the Drain Hose on a Whirlpool Washer\nInsert a plumbing snake into the drain hose, gently pushing it forward to move through bends or obstacles. When you feel resistance, rotate the snake to break up and dislodge the blockage. Keep repeating these steps until the hose is completely clear.\n\nHow to Install the Drain Hose on a Whirlpool Washer\nWhen you're putting the drain hose back, make sure to set up the top of the drainpipe (or standpipe if you have a laundry tub or floor drain) just right—somewhere between 39 and 96 inches above the floor. And keep in mind, the drain hose should only go about 4.5 inches into the drainpipe or standpipe. Avoid using tape to hold the hose because it might mess up the water flow.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nSource: Whirlpool Product Help Library\n\nExplore our genuine OEM drain hoses.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Drain Pump and Filter to Fix a 5d/Sd/Sud Code\nThe drain pump and filter make sure that water gets out of your washer without leaving any debris behind. The drain pump does the hard work, pushing water out, while the filter catches stuff like lint and coins so they don't clog up the pump or sneak into your plumbing. You'll usually find them down at the bottom of your machine, but you can refer to your user manual for the exact placement.\n\nJust like the hose, if the drain pump gets blocked, suds can't leave your washer as fast as they should. That's why you should give it a check if you're dealing with a '5d', 'Sd', or 'Sud' code.\n\nHow to Inspect the Drain Pump and Filter on a Whirlpool Washer\nIf you can, place a couple of wooden blocks under the front legs to lift and tilt the washer; this will make it easier for you to remove the bottom panel. Once the panel is off, you'll see the pump.\nTo take a closer look at the drain pump, place a container beneath it to catch any water left inside, then turn the filter cap counterclockwise to release it (you might need a wrench for this). Carefully disconnect the pump and unplug the wire harness to separate it from the machine.\nHow to Clean the Drain Pump and Filter on a Whirlpool Washer\nIf you spot lint, hair, loose change, or small clothing items inside, just take them out them by hand. Then, rinse away any remaining debris under running water.\nHow to Install the Drain Pump and Filter on a Whirlpool Washer\nScrew the filter cap back on tightly. Reconnect the electrical wires to the pump, and gently slide the pump back where it was. Finally, reinstall the access panel.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM drain pumps and pump filters.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot the Pressure Switch to Fix a 5d/Sd/Sud Code\nThe pressure switch keeps track of and controls how much water is in the drum. You'll usually find it in the control panel at the top of the washer.\n\nHere's how it works: Inside your washer, there's a closed tube connected to the drum. This tube is like the washer's ears for water. When you start a washing cycle, the pressure switch listens for changes in air pressure inside this tube. As your washer fills with water or drains it out, the air pressure inside the tube changes, and the pressure switch reacts to make sure your washer uses the right amount of water for each load.\n\nIf the pressure switch is broken, the washer might overfill with water. Too much water means too many suds, and that's what triggers the error code.\n\nHow to Inspect the Pressure Switch on a Whirlpool Washer\nLet's inspect that pressure switch on your washer. Start by removing the top panel to find it. Once you've got your eyes on it, check for visible issues like cracks, rust, or corrosion on the switch's housing or terminals. Also, give those wires connected to the switch a good look to make sure they're firmly attached and free from damage.\n\nIf you suspect something's not right, you can remove the pressure switch with a flat screwdriver by releasing any clips or fasteners that hold it in place. Remember to detach it along with the clear tube. While you're checking the tube, examine both ends for any debris, sediment, or water. If you spot any blockages, go ahead and clean them out.\nHow to Test the Pressure Switch on a Whirlpool Washer\n\nYou can test the pressure switch using a multimeter. Blow gently into the tube connected to the switch. If you hear a 'click' sound, it means the switch can sense changes in air pressure.  \n\nSet your multimeter to the lowest resistance setting. While blowing gently into the tube, test the terminals in pairs (Terminal 1 and 2, Terminal 2 and 3, Terminal 1 and 3). As you do this, pinch the tube closed to keep the air pressure steady, and write down what happens.\n\nIf the multimeter doesn't show any changes when you blow into the tube, it likely means the switch is not working properly.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nHow to Install the Pressure Switch on a Whirlpool Washer\nWhen the old pressure switch is acting up, it's time to swap it out. To replace it, connect the wires and tube to the new pressure switch, ensuring they're firmly attached. Once the switch is in position, put the washer's top cover back on.\n\nExplore our genuine OEM pressure switches.\n\nPreventing Future 5d/Sd/Sud Codes\nTo keep those '5d', 'Sd', and 'Sud' codes away, let's do your laundry the right way. Follow these steps to prevent too many suds from causing trouble: \nDoing Laundry Properly\nLaundry should be a breeze, not a bubble-filled hassle. By doing each step correctly, you can keep your washer humming smoothly for years to come.\n  \n\n  \n\n\nSorting Your Laundry\nStart by separating your laundry. Keep dark colors like navy blues, blacks, and grays away from white items to avoid dye transfer. Pay special attention to red items, as they tend to release dye easily, so wash them separately, at least at first. Larger items like blankets can be washed together or separately, depending on the load. Always check garment labels for specific washing instructions.\n\nPreparing for the Wash\nBefore you start the wash, make sure to check all pockets and remove any items like keys or tissues that could harm your washer. If you have a front-load washer, load your clothes without twisting or wrapping them around the agitator.\n\nLoading the Drum\nPlace your items inside without cramming too much in. When you put your hand into the drum, there should be enough space for it to move freely.\n\nUsing HE Detergent\nWhirlpool washers are made to use high-efficiency detergent. These detergents are formulated to create fewer suds. Always measure the detergent and follow the manufacturer's instructions based on the size of your load and how dirty your clothes are.\n\nSelecting the Cycle\nChoose the right cycle for your load. Consider the water temperature and cycle length based on the instructions on your garment labels.\n\nCleaning Your Whirlpool Washer\nIt's essential to clean away detergent and fabric softener buildup that can collect over time.\n\nMany Whirlpool models have a nifty \"Clean Washer\" cycle. Just grab the special tablets made for this job, or you can opt for liquid chlorine bleach if you prefer (but always check your use and care guide first).  \n\nAfter you've made your choice, close the washer door, select the cleaning cycle or a regular one with hot water, and let the machine do its thing.  \n\nWhen it's done, leave the door open to air-dry the tub, and don't forget to give the detergent compartment and its surroundings a quick wipe-down now and then.\n\nMaintaining the Drainage System\nTo keep your washer's drainage system happy, a little monthly TLC does the trick.\n\nStart by checking the drainage hose to make sure it's clear of any gunk. You can use compressed air to blow through it or a plumbing snake for a deeper clean.\nAlso, make sure the drainage hose isn't twisted or bent out of shape.\nLastly, don't forget to clear out the pump filter regularly.\n\n\nA round of applause, please! With the '5d,' 'Sd,' or 'Sud' issue now solved, Laundry Day can reclaim its title as the least exciting but most satisfying day of the week.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

You may notice that the touch controls are either unresponsive or responding in a different location than where you actually touched. Seeing this error code displayed on your oven can be frustrating, but this step-by-step guide is designed to provide you with all the information you need to clear the code and restore your oven in no time!\n\nHow to Reset Your Samsung Range to Clear a C-F2 Error\nThe most common way to clear the C-F2 error on your Samsung range is to reset the appliance. The steps for resetting your oven might vary slightly depending on the exact model you own, therefore, it’s always a good idea to consult your manual when you are unsure. However, you can follow the methods listed below which are applicable for a wide range of Samsung ovens:\n\n1. Unplug the Range\nAccess the rear side of your appliance and unplug the oven from the power outlet.Wait for 1-3 minutes and then plug back it in and check to see if the code is cleared.\n\n2. Switch Off the Circuit Breaker\nLocate the circuit breaker, which you can find behind the service panel in your home. Flip the switch labelled \"oven\" or \"stove\" to switch off the circuit breaker to your oven. Wait for 1-3 minutes and then flip the switch again.Wait for your oven to restart and confirm that the error code is no longer displayed.\n\nIf you followed the steps above to clear the C-F2 error code from your oven and the error code is still displayed, there is likely a fault either in the touchpad, the control board, or the wire harness that connects them, known as the ribbon cable. To remove the code and fix your oven, you will need to access and replace these faulty part(s). Before beginning any repairs, ensure that the circuit breaker is switched or the oven is disconnected from the power source to prevent electrical shocks.\n\nHow to Resolve the C-F2 Communication Error in a Samsung Range\n1. Touchpad\nThe touchpad (touch IC) is the user interface for the oven. It allows you to use and control all the functions of your oven such as the temperature, cooking modes, and timers. When you press a button or touch a part of the touchpad, it sends a signal to the control board, which then processes the input and responds in the appropriate way. If the touchpad itself is malfunctioning, you may be unable to control these functions and you may be faced with the C-F2 error.\nFind the right touchpad for your Samsung range.\n\n2. Ribbon Cable\nThe ribbon cable is a flat, wide cable made up of several small wires. It connects the touchpad to the control board and provides the communication link that allows you to use your oven. When you make a selection on the touchpad, the instruction is sent through the ribbon cable to the control board for processing. Similarly, feedback from the control board to update the display or illuminate certain indicators on the touchpad is also sent via this cable. If this cable is not well-connected, damaged, or experiencing electrical failure, it will not be allow communication to flow between the touchpad and control board, resulting in the C-F2 error. \nFind the right replacement cable for your Samsung range.\n\n3. Control Board\nThe control board (main or submicom), is connected to the touchpad and digital display. It manages and regulates the various functions of the range using instructions from the touchpad. It also communicates with various sensors within the oven to ensure the selected function is achieved. If it is malfunctioning, it may not be able to communicate with the touchpad, resulting in the C-F2 error. You may also have difficulties controlling the oven or using the touchpad itself. \nFind the right replacement control board for your Samsung range.\n\nHow to Replace the Touchpad or Ribbon Cable in a Samsung Oven to Clear C-F2 Error\n\n\nTo access the touchpad you will need to begin by removing the mounting screws that hold the control panel to the oven. You can typically find them around the perimeter or  inside the top edge of the oven door frame.\nCarefully lift or tilt the control panel forward.\nLocate the touchpad which will be connected to the control board with a ribbon cable, and take a picture of how the cable is routed and connected.\nInspect the cable and touchpad to check if they are securely connected, or if there are signs of damage or electrical failure.\nOnce you have confirmed a fault in the touch pad or ribbon cable, you can replace the faulty part to clear the C-F2 error code. \nRemove any clips or fasteners that secure the cable and carefully disconnect it from the control board. If the fault is in the ribbon cable, you can now replace it with the new one and reassemble the oven. Otherwise, continue with the next steps to replace the touchpad\nRemove the touchpad from the control panel which may be held in place with adhesive or screws. In the case of adhesive, use a plastic tool to carefully pry the touchpad off to avoid damaging the control panel. \nAttach the new touchpad to the control panel, and ensure that it is oriented correctly and well-secured.\nReconnect the ribbon cable using your photo from earlier.\nPosition the control panel back into its original place and reinstall the mounting screws.\nPlug your Samsung range back into the power outlet or turn on the circuit breaker, and check that the new touchpad functions correctly.\n\n\n\nHow to Replace the Control Board in a Samsung Oven to the Clear C-F2 Error\n\n\nFollow the instructions above to access the control board inside the control panel.\nInspect main control board for signs of displacement or physical damage. If none is present, you can check for electrical failure by using a multimeter to test the terminals on the board for continuity. It is recommended to check your user manual for the specific guidelines on how to do so for your model. \nNext, take an image of how the ribbon cable is routed and connected to the control board for reference later, and disconnect the cable.\nCarefully remove the clips or fasteners that secure the control board, and detach the board from the control panel.\nPosition the new control board in the appropriate position and reconnect the ribbon cable/wire harness using the photos you took earlier.\nSecure the board to the control panel with the appropriate fasteners and reassemble the oven in reverse order.\nPlug the range back or turn on the circuit breaker, and check that the code is cleared and you can now use the touchpad.\n\n\n\nBy carefully following the instructions above and understanding the roles of the touchpad, control board, and the ribbon cable, you can better understand how to resolve the C-F2 error on your Samsung range. Just as in any relationship, sometimes, a little hiccup in communication arises. If you are ever in doubt in the future, don't hesitate to refer back to this guide or consult a professional.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

The error is mainly caused by a blockage in the filter, but can also be caused by blockages in other parts of the dishwasher such as the drain hose, drain pump, or by improper installation of the dishwasher. If this error is displayed, you will notice that the water drains very slowly or collects at the bottom of your dishwasher.\nThis easy-to-follow guide will show you how to find and clear the blockage, and how to inspect various parts of your dishwasher that may be causing the drainage problems. \n\nWhat Is the Most Likely Cause of The E24 Error for New Bosch Dishwasher Owners? \nIf you are the proud new owner of a Bosch dishwasher, it may be frustrating to see this error code displayed. However, there’s no need to panic, this is a common issue that you can resolve quickly.\nFor newly installed dishwashers, here are the most common causes of the E24 error:\n\n\nIncorrect high loop installation: It is recommended to install the drain hose with a high loop to prevent water from flowing back from the sink into the dishwasher. If the drain hose is not is looped at the correct height above the dishwasher's base level during installation, water may flow backwards, resulting in drainage issues.\nImproper air gap installation: The air gap is a device that connects to the dishwasher's drain hose and the sink's drain or garbage disposal to prevent water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Inspect these connection points to ensure they are properly aligned and securely fitted.\nNot removing the knockout plug: The knockout plug is a piece of plastic or metal found at the connection point between the drain hose and garbage disposal. If you are connecting your dishwasher to a garbage disposal for the first time, this plug needs to be removed (knocked out) to allow water to drain from the dishwasher into the disposal. If the plug is not removed, the dishwasher won't drain, and the E24 error code will be displayed. \n\n\n\nWhat are the Most Common Causes of the Bosch E24 Error?\nUse the list below to inspect the parts of your dishwasher that are most likely to be the reason why your dishwasher is not draining and displaying the E24 error code. It's important to follow the list in the order displayed to make the troubleshooting process as efficient as possible. Before beginning any work on your Bosch dishwasher, first turn off the appliance, and unplug it from the power outlet to prevent electrical shock. Lastly, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. \n\nDirty Filter\n It is common for food particles and debris to build up in the filter. At first, a clogged filter will result in unpleasant odors and poorly cleaned dishes by recirculating dirty water in the dishwasher. Over time, a consistently blocked filter will restrict the flow of water and prevent drainage. \n\nHow to Clear a Blockage in the Filter\n\n\nThe filter is located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. To access it, open the dishwasher door and remove the lower rack and spray arm.\nCarefully lift/twist the filter out and inspect it for food debris and foreign objects.\nIf the filter is dirty, you can either run it under warm water to rinse it off or use a soft brush to gently scrub it. Do not use any harsh cleaners or materials that may damage the filter.\nBefore returning the filter to the appliance, inspect the filter mounting area and remove any debris that may be present.\nPress or twist the filter in to place and reattach the lower rack and spray arm.\nIf your dishwasher is still experiencing drainage issues, you should inspect the drain hose next.\n\n\n\nBlocked/Kinked Drain Hose\nThe drain hose transports wastewater out of the dishwasher to the sink's drain or garbage disposal. If the hose is kinked, bent, or clogged with debris or buildup, it will be unable to carry out its function.\n\n How to Clear a Blockage in the Drain Hose\n\n\nTo access the drain hose, you will need to first remove the dishwasher’s bottom front panel, also known as the kick plate. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold it in place.\nLocate the drain hose and inspect the high loop to ensure that it is not kinked or bent. Adjust the hose as needed.\nDisconnect the drain hose from the dishwasher by using a pair of pliers to remove the clamp that holds it in place (place a bucket or towel beneath the hose connection as you do this, as it is common for some water to spill out).\nInspect the hose for signs of blockage and if present, use a long, flexible brush or similar tool to push the blockage out. \nAlternatively, you can run water through the hose to help push out the blockage.\n Once the hose is clear, you can reconnect it to the dishwasher. Be sure to tighten the clamp appropriately to prevent leaks.\nPlace the kick plate back in its position and screw it in securely.\nYou can test the dishwasher by plugging it back in, turning on the water supply, and running a short cycle to ensure that it drains properly.\n\n\n\nBlocked Drain Pump\n The drain pump can become clogged with food debris and objects flowing through the hoses, typically at the inlet/outlet points. A blockage in the drain pump is commonly accompanied by humming and grinding noises. \nIt is important to note that a damaged/faulty pump will also cause drainage problems in your dishwasher, however, this will typically be accompanied by an E25 error. The pump will need to be replaced entirely to restore the appliance. \n\nHow to Clear a Blockage in the Drain Pump\n\n\nTo access the drain pump, follow the same method for accessing the drain hose by following the steps above. \nLocate the drain pump, usually towards the front of the appliance, and detach the hose(s) from the pump. It is normal for some water to spill out at this point.\nGently turn the impeller on the pump. If it does not turn freely, it may either be damaged or clogged. \nInspect the inlet and outlet points on the pump for food particles, or other foreign objects that may be causing an obstruction.\nClear any blockages present. Use a pair of needle nose pliers if the items are hard to reach.\nOnce you have removed the obstructions, you can reattach the hoses and reassemble the dishwasher.\n \n\n\nLoose Pump Cover\nThe pump cover (or impeller cover) allows water to flow through the drain pump. If the cover is loose or misaligned it will prevent the impeller from spinning freely and pushing water out of the dishwasher. It will also increase the likelihood of blockages in the drain pump by allow debris and foreign objects to enter the pump. \n\nHow to Check the Pump Cover\n\n\n\nDepending on your dishwasher model, you may be able to access the drain pump from inside the dishwasher tub, by removing the lower rack, spray arm, and filter. \nIf you cannot access the pump cover from inside the tub, you will need to remove the kick plate at front of the dishwasher to access it.\n Inspect the pump cover for cracks or breaks that may be preventing the cover from sealing properly. If it is damaged it will need to be replaced, otherwise move to the next step.\nGently tug the cover to check that it does not move freely. If cover appears to be loose, carefully press it in place or twist it until it is secure.\n\n\n\nBlocked Air Gap\nThe air gap prevents backflow through the drain hose during drainage. If the air gap becomes clogged with debris and foreign objects, water will flow backwards into the dishwasher through the drain hose, instead of flowing out. A blocked air gap will also cause water to overflow from the air gap onto kitchen the countertop. \n\nHow to Clear a Blockage in the Air Gap\n\n\nPull/twist off the air gap cap. Some air gaps have a second plastic cap underneath which will need to be removed as well. \nLook inside the air gap for visible obstructions and remove any debris that may be present.\nUse a small brush or cloth to clean the inside of the air gap. \nReattach the air gap cap(s) and run a short cycle to test the dishwasher. \n\n\n\n  If you noticed that your dishwasher could use some new parts, you can use our model number search feature to easily find the right replacement part from our list of genuine OEM Bosch Dishwasher Parts. You can make every cycle a sparkling success. \n\n How to Address the Bosch E24 Error if the Steps Above Are Not Working \nFollowing the steps above is the best way to resolve the E24 error code and restore your dishwasher’s draining function. However, it is possible that the code may still be present after following the above instructions. Here’s what to do next:\n\n\nReset the dishwasher: The persistent error may be caused by a glitch in the control panel. To reset the dishwasher and clear the code, you should check your owner’s manual for specific instructions for your model type. However, the most common method is to press and hold the start button or the drain and cancel buttons for 3 – 5 seconds.\nUse a popular bypass hack: If resetting the dishwasher does not resolve the error code, a popular trick used by some Bosch dishwasher owners is to start a cycle, wait 1-2 minutes, and then quickly open and close the door.\nCall a professional: If you are still facing difficulties with your dishwasher, it is worthwhile to consider seeking assistance from a professional appliance repair technician. They will likely be able to diagnose the problem for you and resolve it in no time.\n\n\n\nHow to Maintain Your Bosch Dishwasher and Prevent Future Errors\nIt is important to periodically check and clean your dishwasher to extend its longevity and keep it running efficiently. Poor drainage is not only frustrating, it can also become a health concern due to the growth of mold and bacteria in stagnant water. So, follow these steps to keep your dishwasher running efficiently: \n\n\nRegularly clean and replace the filter. \nRinse dishes to remove large food particles before loading. \nAvoid overloading the dishwasher, as it can prevent proper drainage. \nUse the correct amount and type of detergent to prevent excess suds. \nRun a cleaning cycle once a month. \n\n\nEncountering the Bosch dishwasher E24 error code may seem daunting at first, but if you follow the troubleshooting steps in this guide, you can tackle this issue with confidence and enjoy clean, hassle-free dishwashing once again.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

A clean microwave not only looks better, but it also prevents bacteria from building up. If this is a chore you’ve been putting off, our how-to guide will show you just how easy it is to get your microwave sparkling again. The best part, no harsh chemicals are needed – just some common household items!\n\n \n \n \n\n\nSteam Clean the Interior\n\nThe interior of your microwave is subjected to all sorts of spills and splatters. Instead of using harsh chemicals or scrubbing at the crusty buildup, we’re going to put the microwave to work. By creating steam inside the microwave, it will loosen up all the gunk and make it easier to wipe away. To do this, you’ll need a mug of water and your choice of vinegar, lemon juice, or dish soap. Add either a couple tablespoons of vinegar or lemon juice, or a couple drops of dish soap, and place the mug in your microwave. Let the microwave run for two or three minutes to heat up the water, and then let it sit for another few minutes to let the steam do its work.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCarefully remove the mug, the glass tray, and the carriage from the microwave. Don’t throw out the water, as we’ll use that vinegar solution again later. Using a clean, soft cloth, wipe down the walls, ceiling, and base of the microwave cavity. The steam should've done the hard work and any stuck-on food should now wipe away easily. Be mindful not to use too much pressure, especially around the fragile plastic or mica cover on the wall. To finish up the interior, wipe it down again with a paper towel to ensure everything is dry.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nClean the Tray and Carriage\n\nNext up is cleaning off the glass tray and the carriage. The steam should’ve loosened up any spills, but if there are some stubborn bits just leave these in a sink full of warm soapy water to soak for a bit. Gently scrub off the stuck-on bits, then wipe everything dry with a soft cloth. The carriage and tray can then be placed back inside the microwave, making sure they're in the proper position and that the tray is level.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nClean the Door\n\nThe microwave door is likely made up of plastic and glass, so to clean this we’re going to use our water and vinegar solution from earlier. Use a soft cloth to clean off all the splatters, and then dry the surface with a paper towel. With the inside of the door cleaned up, we’re now finished with the interior of the microwave – the worst of it is now done!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nClean the Exterior\n\nWe’re next going to use the water and vinegar solution to clean the exterior of the microwave. Use a soft cloth to wipe down the sides, top, and back of the microwave if you have a countertop version. To clean the front, with the glass door and the control panel, we’re going to use a glass cleaner. Be sure to spray the cleaner onto your cloth or paper towel – never spray directly onto the buttons or control panel. If you have an over-the-range model, now would be a good time to inspect the filters to see if they should be cleaned or replaced.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nWhile cleaning your microwave, you may have discovered that you need a new filter, or perhaps your glass tray was cracked. If this has happened, we have you covered! Just search for your model number to find hundreds of OEM replacement parts for your microwave.

From quickly tackling dirt on the floor to pet hair in the couch, it seems like they can handle anything you throw at them. But did you know there are some messes that just shouldn’t be vacuumed away? We’re sharing six different items you should avoid vacuuming and providing some alternative methods to clean them up. Then we’ll take apart a vacuum and help you troubleshoot some issues!\n\n \n \n \n\n\nBroken Glass\n\nThe number one item we avoid cleaning up with a vacuum cleaner is broken glass. Regardless of the size of the chips or shards, glass pieces will be very sharp and standard household vacuums aren’t designed to clean them up. Modern vacuums, especially those with a rotating powerhead, actually have an electrical circuit in the hose. Any glass sucked up through there can cause damage to the wires and can be an electric shock hazard. Replacing this type of hose can be very expensive. Once you have the larger pieces of glass swept or carefully picked up, a trick to collecting the small fragments is with a slice of soft bread or a damp paper towel!  The tiny fragments will stick to these surfaces, so you don’t end up stepping on them later.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nSharp Metal Objects\n\nThumbtacks, pushpins, small nails, staples, or paperclips – any of these small, sharp, metal objects can cause damage to your vacuum. If your vacuum has a beater-bar type of head attachment, these metal objects can be especially harmful to the bar. Stick with the broom and dustpan to clean these up!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCoins\n\nAnother small metal object you should avoid vacuuming is coins. Coins can cause damage to the rotating brush on the powerhead of your vacuum cleaner. We don’t have any hacks to share here, you’ll just need to bend down to pick up any dropped coins – that’s probably easier than sifting through a dusty canister anyways!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nFine Dust\n\nUnless your vacuum has a HEPA filter, fine dust is just going to pass right through the filter and circulate back into your room. Avoid vacuuming up drywall dust, sawdust, and even flour. We do have a trick to avoid drywall dust when hanging items on the wall. Simply fold up a sticky note and place it where you intend to drill a hole, and the paper will catch the drywall dust as it falls.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nFire Ash\n\nAsh from your woodstove or fireplace is another item that should not go into your vacuum. First, it can pose a fire hazard if some parts are still hot, and secondly, the ash is also too fine for most vacuum filters. You’re better off using a dustpan and shovel to remove this.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nLiquids\n\nUnless you have a vacuum specifically designed for wet use, you should never clean up liquids with your vacuum. The liquid will coat the inside of the hoses, the filter, and the canister. Since these parts are not designed to get wet, they could eventually become moldy which then becomes a health hazard.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nIf you’ve mistakenly used your vacuum on one of these messes before, don’t fret! Just make sure it’s not a regular habit and your vacuum will thank you. If something has gone wrong, we’re next going to show you how to disassemble a vacuum and inspect it.\n\nVacuum Troubleshooting\n\nWe generally do DIY repairs on major appliances, but we wanted to see if we could salvage this vacuum and keep it out of the landfills. This particular vacuum we’re demonstrating with never worked, even right out of the box, so we wanted to try out some different troubleshooting techniques to see if we could get it operational.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nVisual Inspection and Testing\n\nThe first thing we’re going to do is a visual inspection of the vacuum. Take a look for any cracks, dents, or other signs of damage. Looking closely, we can confirm that this machine has never been run, as the canister and filters are clean. Our power cord looks to be in good shape as well, with no cracks or frays. Since we found nothing physically wrong with the vacuum, we’re next going to plug it in and turn it on. When we press the start button, nothing happens. Listen carefully when pressing the start button, to see if there is any mechanical action happening – we can determine that the button is making contact with the switch.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nTest the Voltage\n\nNext is to determine if the power cord is actually conducting electricity. We are going to use a tool called a proximity voltage tester. This device can be found at most hardware stores, and unlike a multimeter, it doesn’t need to make physical contact with a wire. However, all it is going to tell you is if there is live voltage, it doesn’t give you a reading like a multimeter would. To use this tool, just hold it nearby, or in proximity, and the device will have a flashing light if the wire is live. Using this tool, we can see that the power cord on this vacuum has voltage, but we aren’t getting any signal from the switch. We can determine that a connection is lost between the switch and the power cord, and will need to disassemble the vacuum to confirm this.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nTake the Vacuum Apart\n\nThe first step in disassembling the vacuum is removing the canister and filter assembly. With that piece out of the way, we have access to several screws that hold the appliance together, along with a seam that indicates the vacuum separates into two parts. Remove all the screws, including those found near the power cord, the back filter, and underneath the power button. You may need to use a putty knife or flat blade screwdriver to get the button popped off.  With all the screws removed, you can then use the putty knife to gently pry the vacuum open at the seam.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nInspect the Wires\n\nWith the vacuum now opened up, we can see that the wires connected to the switch are securely attached to the terminals. We then follow the wires back to see where they connect to on the other end. There is an assembly on the opposite side of the vacuum, where the power cord would fit in. We can see that one of the two wires that connect to the power switch is not attached to its terminal. We’re going to connect the loose wire to the terminal with the locking tab, and then we’ll check if this resolved our problem.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nTest Your Work\n\nNow that we have the wire reconnected, we are cautiously optimistic that was the cause of the vacuum not powering on. Next, we’re going to carefully test it out. Since we still have the vacuum disassembled that means there are exposed circuits, so we’re going to be careful plugging it in and pressing the switch. Success - the vacuum now powers on!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nBy inspecting all elements of the vacuum, both external and internal, we were able to troubleshoot and resolve the lack-of-power issue and save this vacuum from the landfill.

If it's too hot or too cold, it can make\n cooking extremely difficult, and leave you with undercooked or overcooked food, neither of which is good! Before you throw your oven to the curb or call\n your local technician, there are a few things you can check on, and small and inexpensive parts that can be easily replaced to get it back up and running\n again. We will walk you through which components may be causing this issue, where they are located, and how to test them.\n \n \n\n\n\nCheck for Power to the Range \n\nThe first step of this diagnosis is to determine whether you have the proper power going to the range. Most applications use either 208 volts ac or 240\n volts ac to power the range. The easiest way to check if you have the proper power is to use the surface burners. Simply turn them on to a high setting,\n verify that they heat up properly, and if they do, you can assume the power is correct. If the surface burners don’t appear to be working properly,\n go back to your electrical panel and check the fuses or the breaker to see if the problem lies there. If you have determined that you have proper power\n going to the range, the next step will be to check the individual elements in the oven.\n \n Check the Oven Elements \n \n All ranges use both the bake and broil elements in any cooking function, so the easiest way to test them is to simply pick a broil function, set it to broil, open the oven door, and then feel for any heat coming from that broil element. Use caution because it is fairly close to the front. To test the bake\n element, we’ll set it to a bake function. Again, check for heat coming from the element. If it is warming up, you’ll know that the element is working fine\n as well. On some ranges the bake element is hidden. Again, you would still select a bake function, and although it takes a little bit longer, you should\n feel some heat coming from the bottom of that oven pan. So, if our visual inspection of the elements didn’t indicate that they were defective, but they\n still don’t heat, our next step is to do a continuity test on them. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Run a Continuity Test on the Elements \n \n Start by removing the back panel and make sure that the power to the range is turned off. We also suggest that you take at least one of the wire\n terminals off of the element. Inspect those terminals to make sure that they are in good condition. Using a multimeter set to a resistance scale, check\n for continuity on the broil element. Typically, you’ll see somewhere between 50 and 15 ohms resistance. If after testing, you have determined that the\n element is working properly, do the same procedure on the bake element to verify that it is working as well.  \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Check the Oven Thermostat Control\n \n On manual control ranges, if both the elements have passed their test but you still don’t have the proper temperature, you will want to check the oven\n thermostat control next. The control itself has a switch body that is in the console and it has a capillary tube with a temperature sensing bulb. That\n temperature sensing bulb sits along the wall inside of the oven either on a side wall or on the ceiling. It is used to monitor the temperature in the\n oven, and it sends that information to the control. You will need to inspect the temperature sensing bulb to verify that it's not damaged or that the\n capillary tube is not damaged. You will also want to check to make sure it is mounted firmly in the clips that are holding it in place. If that appears\n normal, you may have a control that is out of calibration. Typically, you can adjust these plus or minus 25 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. To do this, remove\n the control knob and then use a very small blade screwdriver by putting it through the center and adjusting it one way or the other to compensate for those\n temperatures. If that does not resolve your issue, you can assume that the control is bad, and you’ll need to replace it.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Check the Thermostat for Continuity\n \n The first step will be to turn the control to a preset temperature of around 300 degrees or so. On the backside of that control, you’ll need to\n determine which of the contacts you’ll need to test for continuity, based on your model and the wiring diagram that comes with your oven. On our example\n oven in the video, we determined we do have continuity in the bake circuit, so next we checked the broil circuit. Again, turn the control to a broil\n function, and using your multimeter, test for continuity with the proper terminals, and verify that the function works properly.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Check the Temp Sensor \n \n On electric control ranges, they use a device called a temp sensor to regulate the temperature in the oven. If your tests for the bake and broil\n elements have passed, it is safe to suspect that the problem might be with the temp sensor. It is located on the back wall of the oven up close to the top\n and either on the left or right rear corner.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Test the Temp Sensor \n \n Most electronic control ranges will display a fault code, if you have a defective temp sensor, however that’s not always the case. You can test this\n component individually. They have a specific resistance related to the specific temperature of that temp sensor. Using a multimeter, you can test that\n resistance at room temperature and verify that it is working properly. To test the temp sensor, you will need to remove the back panel from the range to\n locate it and the harness connector. You’ll need to separate the harness connector. if your metal leads are too large to fit in the front side of that,\n you can flip it over and perhaps get in from the backside. If not, you can follow that harness all the way back to the control board. You can then\n disconnect that connector from the control board and do your measurements from that side. If you choose that method, make sure that you reconnect the\n small harness to your temperature to keep that wiring in circuit. Typically, the resistance of that temp sensor at room temperature is about 1050 to\n 1100 ohms. Pick the appropriate scale on your multimeter. If it is significantly different from those numbers at room temperature, you may assume that\n the temp sensor is defective, and giving a false reading to the electronic control.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Check the Control Board and Adjust Settings\n \n If the temperature sensor has checked out as okay, you may still have an issue that is related to the control itself. Most manufacturers have made a\n provision that you can offset the temperature of the oven by plus or minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Check your user guide to verify how to do that. It is\n simply a keypad function that you can either trick that oven into thinking it is warmer than it is or cooler than it is to compensate for it. To verify\n that you don’t have a temperature offset programmed into the electric range control, follow the manufacturer's instructions. For the model we used in the\n video example, it asks us to hold the bake function for about 5 seconds, and that will display any current offset that has been programmed in.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n We hope that by following these steps, we’ve helped you diagnose your own oven heating issues. Replacing these parts yourself will not only allow you\n to repair your existing oven, but it can save you a lot of money in repairs and replacements.

Most North\n American homes use forced-air heating with boilers and radiators being the most popular. We decided to look at some alternative heating solutions in the\n event that you may be looking for an additional heating source to your current one or are looking to switch the main heating source altogether. There are\n many different options and styles, and we examined some of the pros and cons of each.\n \n \n\n\n \n Portable Heaters\n \n Electric Heaters\n \n The first type of heater we will cover are the small portable ones. There are electric heaters only, propane, and electric oil-filled heaters as well.\n The benefit of electric ones is that all you require is your basic household outlet. Turn them on and away they go. You’ll want to pay attention to the\n safety features that may be built into the unit. For example, if they get tipped over, some will shut themselves off, a great feature if you are concerned\n about safety (and who isn’t?).\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Oil-Filled Electric Heater\n \n Another option is an oil-filled electric heater. The example in our video is a 110-volt heater. It just simply plugs into a wall. This trouble-free\n option requires little maintenance. The benefit of this type is that once it has heated up, it will continue to radiate heat even after it is\n cycled off. A lot of these heaters also have a water tank. You can just put a little bit of water in it and set it on the heater, and it will actually work as a\n bit of a humidifier, which is really good because in the wintertime when the air is dry, that bit of moisture in the air is really beneficial. They also\n have safety switches, so if they do happen to get bumped over and tipped, they will shut themselves off, so they are a very safe and practical type of heat as well. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n\nPropane-Based Heater\n \n One other variety we looked at is a propane-based heater. It just takes a propane tank that connects to the back and has its own igniter. You just turn\n on the gas, hit the igniter, and this will give you some infrared heat. The downside to this type is that because you are burning fuel, you will need to\n be aware of the health and safety concerns that come with burning a gas product.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Electric Fireplaces\n \n The next heat source we examined is one that has become extremely popular, and that's the electric fireplace. Much like the space heater that we talked\n about earlier, it just plugs into a wall and works on your regular house power supply. This option is more about ambiance than it is about the heat.\n You'll have realistic-looking flames and a remote control that allows you to turn the heat and/or flames on and off. You're able to adjust your flame\n setting for high or low, depending on your preference. They can be put in any size room, but being on a 120-volt outlet you're only getting about fifteen\n hundred watts of heat from it. It really is just more about the look than a practical heat source.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n Mini-Split Heat Pump\n \n The next heat source we looked at was extremely popular in new house construction and for renovations, which is the heat pump in the mini-split version.\n Mini-split is a common term you hear, and why they call it a mini-split is because of two main components. The first is a main fan unit and coil that\n mounts outside your home, with a compressor and fan motor in it. The other main unit is mounted in your house, on a wall, or in the ceiling, and it's\n there to provide the cooling or heating as you require it. This type of heat is available in many different output amounts from 18,000 BTUs. They are\n very energy efficient. The only downside to them is that most of them require 220-volts to run. To do that, you may require an electrician to come in\n and provide the power supply for it. The mini-split is something that becomes part of your home, once it's installed it stays there, and it's recommended\n that you have a certified installer do that.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Wood Heating Sources\n \n The next category we examined was providing heat with the use of wood, and that can come in two forms, either by the old standby that we're all quite\n used to, the split wood that is burned, or the other version that's becoming very popular, and that's the pellet stove. This is a great heating source to\n have if the area you live in is prone to power outages.\n \n Pellet Stove\n \n The pellet stove uses wood pellets that are created from scrap wood, so it is very environmentally friendly because it's taking pieces of wood and\n scrap wood that were being discarded and are now being processed and made into pellets. Pellet stoves are a great option because they take up less space\n in your home. They come available in either freestanding or as an insert, so they can replace your old fireplace. One of the best\n features of the pellet stove is they do need to be vented outside, but they don't require the typical chimney that a wood stove does. It's just a small\n direct vent that just goes out through the wall, so your cost of installation is much lower than if you were doing the typical wood-type stove. They do\n require a 115-volt outlet to plug into, because they're running two motors: a fan motor that's supplying air to the burner box, as well as an\n auger motor that's feeding the pellets into the burner box. They provide a large amount of heat, they are efficient, and the cost of installation is much\n less than the other wood-style burning stoves.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Wood Stove\n \n The last heat source we looked at is the good ol’ wood stove. Using a wood stove is extremely efficient. One of the beauties of a wood stove is the\n amount of heat that they generate. Even after the fire is out, they're still bringing in a lot of heat into the room. When it comes to being energy\n efficient, they are a top contender. A downside to the woodstove is that there is a little bit of a higher cost to install. You will also need more space around\n it because of the amount of heat generated, so space is another factor to consider. When it comes to safety, there are some concerns regarding how much\n flammable material is around them and how close the stove is to that material. They require some cleanup and maintenance, as well as maintenance to the chimney, such as making\n sure it is clear and free-flowing so there are no concerns about fire or smoke getting back into your home. You’ll also need to consider wood supply.\n Do you have an ample source of wood, and how are you going to buy it? Are you going to buy it in full length and cut it and split it yourself? Or will you\n buy it already processed so that you can just stack it and put it into your stove as you need to? You will also need to think about how much space you will\n require to store that wood and keep it dry for use. A lot to consider!\n \n When it comes to deciding on a heat source for your space, it really comes down to what your individual needs are, where you're looking to put your heat source, how\n big the area is, what you are looking to heat, or if you're really just looking for ambiance. We hope by highlighting some of these popular options, we have helped you narrow down your decision that is best suited for your space.

If you live in a region that experiences freezing temperatures and snowstorms, this time of year presents some extra challenges. We want to help keep your family and your home safe this season, so we’ve put together this guide with our best outdoor winter safety tips. From ensuring your equipment is ready to go, to having an emergency kit in your car, being prepared will be your best defense against winter.\n\n \n \n\n\nSnow and Ice Removal\n\nPaths and Driveways\n\nThis category is an important one, as it’s not just you and your family using your paths and driveway. Delivery and service people, along with guests to your home can all risk an injury if the paths are not cleared properly. Check the condition of your snow shovels and scrapers and replace them if necessary. Make sure they’re easily accessible when the time comes. Snowblowers should be maintained, and you should have fuel ready to go.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nHave a supply of salt or ice melt, sand, or gravel on hand. Be sure that products like ice melt or salt are safe for pets, your lawn, and your well and septic system if applicable. Sand, gravel, or kitty litter can help provide traction on the pathways. If there are stairs leading up to your doors, ensure that railings are secure and stable. Loose railings could lead to further injuries when someone reaches for them if they slip on the stairs.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nIcicles\n\nSnow and ice don’t just need to be removed from driveways – look up! Rooves, gutters, eavestroughs, and trees all need your attention. While icicles can be beautiful and festive, they can also be a hazard. If they are forming, be sure to remove them before they fall on someone. Icicles can also be an indicator of ice dams forming on your roof. The best way to prevent ice dams is by ensuring that your attic is properly insulated and ventilated. This will prevent the warm air from your home from entering the attic, which causes the snow to melt, and then refreezes into the much colder gutters in the form of icicles.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nTree Branches\n\nIf you have not cleared dead or broken tree branches in the fall, be mindful of them in the winter. With snow and ice covering them, they are further weakened and can break off entirely. Depending on their location, these branches could fall on your house, car, or on a person. Eliminate this hazard by cutting back any damaged or dead trees. If any broken branches are in your yard, they should be removed as they can be a tripping hazard, especially when covered in snow.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nAdequate Lighting\n\nAn unfortunate part of winter is that it's dark out when you leave for work, and it is dark again by the time you get home. Ensure that you have full visibility at night by having adequate lighting along your walkways and on the porch. You may want to consider lights with solar power, motion detectors, or on timers so that they are on and ready once the sun sets.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nMaintain Your Equipment\n\nIf you own them, make sure your snowblower and generator are properly maintained and ready to go for any winter storms. When you take them out of storage, do a general maintenance tune-up and make sure they are operating properly. Purchase fresh fuel to have on hand, and make sure you have an appropriate storage container for it – do not store the fuel in the snowblower or generator. You will also want to make sure you have appropriate oil levels, and fresh spark plugs on hand. Ensure that the belts are not worn out and that they are properly adjusted – it wouldn’t hurt to keep a spare ready to go. On your snowblower, check that the chutes work properly, and all moving parts have been lubricated. You should also keep some extra shear bolts on hand. If one breaks it can easily be replaced and you’ll be back up and running. If you have an electric snowblower, ensure that the power cord and extension cord are in good condition – there should be no cracking or fraying. If you have a battery-powered model, have some spare batteries charged and ready to go.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nPreparing Your Vehicle\n\nYou won’t always be cozy at home when the snow falls, so you want to ensure that your vehicle is properly equipped! Check that your snow brushes and scrapers are in good condition and replace them if necessary. Keep spare windshield washer fluid that is rated for winter temperatures in the car or trunk, and make sure that the dispenser under the hood is filled up. In the trunk, you should keep a bag of sand or kitty litter, as it can provide traction if your tires are stuck. A small shovel can also help, especially with keeping snow away from your wheels and exhaust. Along with the standard emergency kit items for your car, add warm blankets and extra hats and mittens for the winter months. If you end up stuck somewhere, you’ll be thankful for the extra layers!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nKeeping your home, car, and equipment maintained and well-stocked will help you get through winter safely! Keeping walkways and gutters clear of ice will ensure there are no accidents waiting to happen. If you’ve noticed you could use some spare or replacement parts, we have you covered!

If you’re able to cook an entire meal without any drips or messes, please share your wisdom! For the rest of us, cleaning up after a meal is inevitable. If you catch them quickly, most dribbles are easy to wipe up. It's when food gets burnt onto the cooktop that the challenge begins. If you’ve ever had a pot of pasta boil over, you understand the struggle. We're sharing a variety of techniques and products you can use to ensure that your glass or ceramic cooktop is as clean and shiny as the day you bought it.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nUsing Commercial Products\n\nIn the cleaning product aisle of your local store, you’ll be able to find a couple of different options made specifically for glass and ceramic cooktops. These products are typically either a cream for deep cleaning, or a spray for daily use. The cream-style cleaners may have a gritty texture, but they are a non-abrasive formula for removing burnt-on spills from your cooktop. The cleaner is poured onto the surface, and then spread out using a soft cloth or paper towel. Buff the product in to remove any stains or build-up from the cooktop. Finish up with a soft dry cloth to polish the stovetop to a shine.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nWhen using a daily spray cleaner, you can use one specifically made for cooktops, but you may also be able to use a glass cleaner or a regular household cleaning product. Check your manufacturer’s guide to be sure that these products will be suitable for your style of cooktop. The spray-on cleaner is a great choice for wiping up after daily use, keeping the cooktop clean and shiny.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nHeavily Stained Range Tops\n\nIf your dinner bubbled over, you may have some stubborn burnt-on stains to deal with. Your regular cleaning spray may not be able to handle this, so we’re turning to alternative methods. Good ol’ baking soda and white vinegar are a great duo for breaking down the burnt-on mess. Simply sprinkle the surface with baking soda, and spray it with vinegar. Let that solution sit for 10-15 minutes.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nIf more food ended up on your cooktop than on your plate, you may need to add an extra step. Soak a washcloth in very hot water and wring it out. Place the cloth on top of the vinegar solution and let them sit. After 15 minutes, use the cloth to scrub the surface and the build-up should now wipe right off.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nUsing Dry Powdered Cleaners\n\nA similar method to using baking soda, powdered household cleaners also work well on smooth cooktops. Dampen the surface, and then sprinkle with the powder cleaner. Again, with any stubborn spots, a hot damp cloth can be placed over the powder. Then after 10-15 minutes the surface can be wiped up and polished to a shine. This type of cleaner should be safe for glass cooktops, but you will want to be mindful of the surrounding surface areas. They may be too abrasive for stainless steel or plastic, so check the information on the product label and consult with your owner’s manual.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nScraping Stubborn Stains\n\nIf you’ve tried all the above methods and there’s still a burnt-on mess, it’s time to bring in some tools. Specifically, a scraper blade. Once again, there are scraper products made specifically for cleaning cooktops, and they’re designed to get the job done without injuring yourself or damaging the surface. Make sure that the cooktop has cooled completely before you begin. Spray the stain with either water, vinegar, or cleaner to moisten it. You will want to use a fresh sharp blade and hold the scraper at a 45-degree angle, then carefully work at removing the buildup. Once the worst of it has been scraped away, you can clean up the rest using one of the previously mentioned techniques.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nOf course, the best way to prevent stubborn burnt-on stains is to clean up any spills when they happen. However, we realize messes happen, and hot burners can prevent quick cleanups. Hopefully these tips and techniques make it easier to clean up your cooktop the next time spills happen. If you’ve discovered that you need some replacement parts for your range, we have you covered.

Ideally, it’s a festive and jolly occasion, but if you’ve ever had to untangle strings of lights, or find that one burnt out bulb, you know it can be more like a nightmare before Christmas. Not to mention the possibility of the tree falling over or catching on fire! We prefer our holidays to be merry and bright, so with this article we’re sharing our best tips when it comes to tree safety and tree-light troubleshooting so that you can enjoy the season without worry. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nSetting up the Tree\nTree Location\n\nBefore you bring your tree home from the lot, or get it out of storage and remove it from the box, the first thing you need to determine is the location for your tree.\n\nIf you have a real tree, there are several factors that you need to consider. Placing your tree near a heat source, such as a fireplace, baseboard heaters, or forced air ducts can all cause your tree to dry out faster. In front of a window can be a nice choice so that the tree can be seen from the street, but if that window gets southern exposure, the direct sunlight can also dry out your tree. Make sure that the location gives you easy access to get underneath and water the tree.\n\nIf you have an artificial tree, those factors aren’t really a concern. For both types of trees, easy access to a power source will make your life easier. You also want to be mindful that it isn’t located in a high traffic area such as near a doorway or hallway.\n\nLighting the Tree\n\nIf you have a natural tree, or your artificial one isn’t pre-lit, you'll need to put lights on the tree. The main options available are either incandescent or LED lights. It is completely your choice which style you prefer to use. Incandescent tend to cost less upfront and have a warmer glow, but LEDs use less energy, last much longer, and are cooler to the touch. For either option, make sure that your lights are UL approved and that there are no cracks or splits in the wires when you take them out of storage for the season. When purchasing strands of lights, a good rule of thumb is to have 100 lights per foot of tree.\n\nSecure the Tree\n\n\nOnce you have the ideal location and the lights perfectly hung, now you want to make sure that it doesn't fall over. Depending on the size of your tree and the number of ornaments you have, securing your tree can be an important task. A good tree stand should be used, but sometimes you may need a bit of extra protection for peace of mind.\n\nIf you tend to put your tree in a corner of the room, you are likely to focus on decorating the front of the tree, leaving it with a sparsely adorned backside. This unbalanced weight can pull your tree forward, potentially causing it to tip over. This can be prevented by simply attaching a hook to your wall, and using a clear string like fishing line, looped around the tree and onto the hook. If your tree is on the larger size, a thin chain may be necessary to keep it vertical.\n\nIf your tree is in front of a window, there are clear plastic hooks you can purchase to secure your tree. These hooks have an adhesive back you can stick to the glass, and then use the same method of looping string around the tree. The clear hook will blend in with your window, and then the adhesive will easily remove without marking once you take the tree down.\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPower Options\nThe next thing to consider is providing power to your tree lights. To do that, we need to have the appropriate cords, whether it's inside or whether it's outside.\n\nPower Bars & Extension Cords\n\nWhen setting up our tree, we recommended selecting a location with easy access to an outlet and inspecting the strands of light to ensure they are in good condition. Sometimes outlets just aren’t in convenient locations, and the use of a power bar or an extension cord may be needed. Make sure that any cords you are using are in good condition and that they are certified for the proper usage. If you put lights up outside that require an extension cord, you need to make sure that cord is rated for outdoor use. Your extension cord should be polarized and have a grounded 3-prong plug. A power bar can be a good choice for indoor use, since they can be easier to access than a wall outlet and provide the extra surge-protection benefit.\n\nTimers\n\nIt's recommended that you don't leave your lights on when you're away from home or through the night when everybody in the house is asleep. Of course, you can just manually turn them off or unplug the lights before bed, but timers can be used for added peace of mind. There are several options available for both your indoor and outdoor lights that allow you to set a lighting schedule.\n\nA mechanical timer lets you program when you want it to turn on and when you want to turn off. For your outdoor lights, there's an option for a timer which uses a photocell, so that'll turn your lights on as the sun goes down. You're able to program the number of hours that you want your lights to be on for, so that after that time has been reached, the lights are turned off.\n\nSmart Outlets\n\nA neat option that is available for tech-savvy users is smart outlets, which lets you turn the outlet on and off using your smart phone. You can do this manually or the app will also let you set a schedule. Your tree will automatically turn on at your designated time of day and turn off again at your specified time.\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTroubleshooting the Tree Lights\n\nIf your lights come out of the box a tangled mess, with only half the bulbs lighting up, we feel for you. We’ll show you how to troubleshoot your light set and get them all working properly so you can put them up on your tree.\n\nTesting the Fuse\n\nMany times, when your lights aren't working properly, there's a fuse inside the cord set that may be causing you the problem. Hidden inside the plug head are the actual fuses for your light set. To access these all you need is a small screwdriver, which is inserted into a slot and pushed forward to open. Once that is opened, you will find your two fuses.\n\nOnce you have the fuses removed, you will want to test them to figure out which one is the problem. There's two ways of testing, either with a multimeter or with a designated light-fixing tool. With the multimeter, you will touch the probes to either end of your fuse. If the fuse is good, the multimeter will make a sound. If using a light-fixing tool, simply drop the fuse into the slot and if it is good the tool will light up and make a sound.\n\nIf your fuse is bad, it will need to be replaced so that your lights continue to work properly. When you purchased your string lights, there was likely a small bag that contained spare bulbs and spare fuses. If you have misplaced this bag, you should be able to find new mini fuses at your local hardware store.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nBulbs and Shunts\n\nIf you have issues with the bulbs or shunts on your string lights, one of these incandescent bulb fixing tools can be extremely useful for troubleshooting. If a bulb isn’t lighting up when the strand is plugged in, you can remove the bulb and test it with the tool. If the bulb doesn’t light up, it’s the problem and can be replaced with a new one. If the bulb lights up in the tool, then there is an issue with the shunt, and it will need to be reset. To do this, insert the shunt into the tool – you will see the lights on the string light up. Then just pull the trigger to reset the shunt.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nHopefully these tips and tricks will save you some frustration this holiday season.

Are you interested in trying to find out ways to maximize the efficiency of your home appliances? \nWe'd like to share with you some energy-saving tips for your refrigerator, to help cut down on costs, and of course, make a difference for the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does a Refrigerator Work?\n\nTo help you with energy costs with your refrigerator, one of the first things that you'll want to consider is how a refrigerator works. Basically, how the\n refrigeration process works is you remove heat from food items and then dissipate that heat into the atmosphere. Keeping that in mind, every time you\n open the refrigerator door, you introduce more heat into that refrigerator and therefore it must work harder to get rid of it.\n \n Tip # 1: Organize Your Refrigerator for Efficiency \n \n The first tip is to properly organize your refrigerator so that you don't stand with the door open while you're searching for an item. Using labels or\n see-through containers are a surefire way to minimize the amount of time that you spend looking for things and leaving the refrigerator door open.\n You should also keep items you use on a regular basis kept on the front of the shelves. Those things that you rarely use should be placed at the back of\n the fridge. Also, keep in mind that not all food items need to be refrigerated, such as soy sauce. Some fruits and vegetables can be kept in a\n container on your countertop. Be sure to check the labels on your food to determine whether the items need to be refrigerated.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Tip # 2: Check for Proper Air Flow\n \n Related to the topic of organizing your refrigerator, you'll also want to keep in mind how much you can put in your model of refrigerator.\n For a refrigerator to work efficiently, it needs to have room for air to flow between the shelves. Air will enter the fresh food compartment on any\n refrigerator, circulate around and exit back into the evaporator area, which is typically located at the back of the freezer. When you impede the airflow,\n this causes the refrigerator to work that much harder to maintain a proper temperature. Keep that in mind, it is important that we don't block the air\n inlet ducts into the fresh food compartment or the return air vents that go back to the freezer. If you find that you need to fill your refrigerator\n completely, you should look at getting a larger size.\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Tip # 3: Cool Items Before Putting Them in the Fridge\n \n Now, along with organizing your refrigerator to minimize door openings, on days that you purchase food items that need to be refrigerated, we suggest\n that you cool them during the transportation process. Simply putting them in a cooler with a few blocks of ice or adding your frozen foods into a cooler\n along with your refrigerated foods allows them to stay cool before they get introduced into your refrigerator. Any time you add room-temperature food\n items to your refrigerator, it has to work that much harder to bring that temperature back down to normal. Also, if you are into pre-cooking meals or\n saving leftovers, allow those to come down to room temperature before introducing them into the refrigerator. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Tip # 4: Utilize the Features in Your Refrigerator\n \n Utilize the features that are present in your refrigerator. Some models will have an energy saver switch that turns an electric heater on or off. If\n you are in an area where there is low humidity or during certain parts of the year, there is low humidity, you simply need to turn that switch off.\n If your refrigerator model has a through-the-door ice and water dispenser, you should also utilize that feature. That prevents opening the door and\n allowing room air temperature into your freezer or your fresh food compartment. Another energy-saving tip is that if you're going to take some frozen\n food to thaw out, simply put it in the fresh food compartment and allow it to thaw out there.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Tip #5: Properly Maintain Your Refrigerator\n \n There are also a few maintenance items that you should pay attention to that will help you save money. First, inspect the door gaskets on both the\n fresh food compartment and the freezer to ensure they're making a nice tight seal. Any time air can leak into that refrigerator, your compressor will run\n longer to maintain that temperature, so make sure that the gaskets are pliable and in good condition. If there are any tears or deformations to them, they\n should be replaced.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Tip # 6: Set the Correct Temperature \n \n The last tip on our list is properly setting your refrigerator controls for the fresh food compartment and the freezer. For the fresh food compartment,\n the optimum temperature is somewhere around two or three degrees Celsius or 37.38 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, for a freezer, you’ll want -18 degrees\n Celsius or zero to five degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure your controls are set to maintain those temperatures. To check those temperatures, we suggest\n that you use an excellent-quality probe-type thermometer. Set a glass of water in your fresh food compartment, allow it to sit there for 12 to 24 hours,\n and test the temperature to see if you need to make an adjustment. Allow another 24 hours before recording the temperature again. In the freezer, we found\n the best item to use is ice cream. Simply insert the probe into the ice cream and check the temperature. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n We hope that some of these tips will help you save money on your next power bill and save you much more if you continue to follow them!

Or opened your dryer and found your go-to jeans were covered in lint or tangled\n up so badly that you needed to iron them? These are very common problems, but luckily, they are avoidable! We’ll share some basic tips and tricks, so you\n don’t end up with a laundry room disaster!\n \n \n\n\n\nHow to Sort Your Laundry\n\nThe first step is to sort the laundry. You’ll want to sort them into piles based on color. One pile for dark items (blacks, navy blues, grays), one pile\n for colored items, and one pile for white items. Mixing darks with whites will run you the risk of color transfer, which of course we do not want. Colored\n items that are new should be washed separately for at least the first few washes (especially red items), this will lessen the likelihood of die transfer\n and will give the die a chance to become stable. Larger items, such as blankets, should also be separated and put into their own pile.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Prepare Your Clothes for the Washer\n \n Now that your clothes are separated by color and size, you will want to check out the garment labels on the individual items to verify that the fabrics\n are compatible with each other. The garment labels may indicate the need to turn certain clothes inside out, or wash in a specific temperature, for example.\n If the labels do not have instructions written out, there will typically be symbols indicating washing instructions. These symbols are universal in nature\n and easily available online for interpretation.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Before you load the washer, you will want to verify that the pockets have been emptied. Items such as keys, screws, nails, and coins can cause some\n damage to your washer. Even something as simple as tissue can create a lot of lint, which makes it difficult to clean.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n How to Load a Front-Load Washer\n \n When loading your front-load washer, take your items, and loosely clump them in a ball and toss them in the machine. The tubs of front-load washers\n are usually larger than a top-load washer, so they are more difficult to overload. Be sure to leave a little bit of room at the top, to allow for some\n expansion and tumbling action.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Add Detergent\n \n When selecting the appropriate detergent for the wash, you will want to consider the garment instructions printed on the label of the clothes. If you have determined that the cold setting will be selected, you may want to choose a detergent that works well for cold-water. Other detergent options may include more gentle ingredients, or harsher ingredients for tough stains. Insert the detergent into the appropriately labelled dispenser. If you do not have a designated dispenser, just simply add it directly into the drum. Using the correct amount of detergent is crucial, and is a common mistake made by many. Most people tend to use far too much detergent in their front load washer, which creates a lot of suds. You may think more suds means a better wash, but that is not the case. Particularly in a front-load washer, excess suds provide a cushion for clothes to drop on and they don’t become as clean. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n How to Select a Cycle for a Front-Load Washer\n \n You will want to pick a cycle that best suits the load that you have in the washer. For the demonstration that we share in our video, we have mostly cotton items, so we selected a normal or cotton cycle. You will then want to select the temperature, and in this case, we selected cold based on the instructions on some of our clothes. Our load is only lightly soiled, so we stuck with a standard cycle. If it was heavily soiled, you would want to add some extra time, or you may wish to add a pre-soak cycle on. Now you can start the cycle.  \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n How to Load a Top-Load Washer\n \n The loading procedure for a top-load washer is slightly different because you will need to take into consideration the agitator in the center of the tub. Refrain from wrapping things around the agitator. If you do that, they tend to become tangled and this often creates excess abrasion on the fabric, which will cause damage to it. Just like the front-load washer, you will need to select the water temperature based on the fabric labels of the load. We picked a cold cycle and a standard single rinse in our video example. Next, you will need to select the water level. Unlike most front-load washers that do that automatically, top-load washers require you to select an option. We suggest picking the water level that most closely matches the load size that you have in the washer or the next largest. The more water you have in a top load washer, the more easily clothes can circulate inside the tub, and the cleaner they will become.\n \n How to Select a Cycle for a Top-Load Washer\n \n Next, you will need to choose the cycle that best suits the fabric. In our video example, we chose a regular cycle. Once that is selected, you just need to press the start button and your wash will begin.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n How to Determine the Dryer Load Size\n \n Once the clothes are done in the washer, you will need to get your dryer ready. The first thing you will want to check is that the items coming from the washer into the dryer are okay to go in the dryer. You will need to check the laundry labels and verify that they are safe to use in the dryer. Secondly, you will want to make sure that you have the proper size load for your dryer. To ensure clothes dry properly they need to be able to tumble freely inside the dryer drum. If you overload the dryer, what typically happens is some items will get caught up in a bundle and won’t dry completely. In some cases, you may need to split the load up to get the best drying results.\n \n Clean the Lint Filter\n \n The next step is making sure the lint filter is clean. A good practice is to check the lint filter before you start each load and clean it at the end of each cycle. Leaving lint in the filter will lessen the efficiency of the dryer and create a major safety hazard if left too long.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Adding Fabric Sheets and Dryer Balls\n \n Before closing the dryer, you will need to decide whether you want to use a fabric sheet, or you may also wish to add some dryer balls. Dryer balls are\n typically a felt or wool material. They open up the clothing as its tumbling in the dryer. They can be a bit noisy, but they allow for better airflow and\n therefore a more efficient dry.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n How to Select a Dryer Cycle\n \n When selecting a dryer cycle, we recommend using an automatic cycle if your machine has one. A sensor dryer or automatic dry cycle is more tailored to\n the load that is in your dryer and tends to not over-dry your items. When selecting the temperature, you will want to consider the items in the dryer and\n whether the garment labels specified a high or low dryer setting. The timing of a sensor dry will vary because it will dry according to the load size. You\n may also have the option to select a permanent press or wrinkle prevention option, which you can select if you so choose. Now you are ready to start the\n cycle\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Removing Items from the Dryer\n \n Once the cycle is complete, we suggest removing all those items as soon as possible. The longer you leave the clothes in the dryer, the more chance you have of wrinkles setting into those items.\n \n We hope our laundry room tips and tricks helped you out on laundry day, and you avoided a laundry room disaster!

Here is a list of \nmust-have items for any DIYers toolbox, why they may need them, and what to consider when it comes to choosing the right one. These gift ideas make excellent\n stocking-stuffers and will help make your loved one’s life a little easier around the house.\n \n \n\n\n\n1. Hex Keys or Allen Keys\n\nThe first item on our list is a set of hex keys or allen keys. They usually come in a folded-up configuration, are lightweight, and easy to use, \nmaking them a perfect stocking-stuffer idea. They are hexagonal bars designed to drive hexagon socketed hardware without contacting the outside of the head.\n They come in multiple sizes that are both metric and SAE sizes (you’ll want to get one with both). This type of hardware is everywhere, from furniture,\n automotive, toys, appliances, and power tools. The most common and versatile is the classic L-shape wrenches, so this is a good starting point. You’ll\n also want to look for an oxide or stainless-steel finish, to ensure it stays rust-free and will last them a lifetime.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 2. Putty Knife\n \n Nothing can replace a simple and dependable putty knife, perfect for everyday DIY projects. The putty knife is a DIY must-have. They are usually made\n of rigid plastic or metal, and either of these materials can be flexible or stiff. The type you choose depends on the job at hand, so you will want to\n consider what they may be using it for. They are a multi-purpose tool that you can use for just about anything around the home, including hanging drywall,\n removing wallpaper, filling nail holes, removing old grout, and the list goes on!\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 3. Snap-Ring Pliers\n \n A tool that you can never find a true substitute for is a pair of snap-ring pliers. This is a hand tool used for installing and removing snap rings.\n They differ from other pliers as they have a tip designed for handling snap rings. We recommend a set with both internal and external settings on it, and\n replaceable tips in case one breaks.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 4. Magnetic Pickup\n \n When working on projects and repairs, if you ever drop something, such as small parts, tools, or fasteners, it is typically in an area where you can’t\n quite reach. This is where an extendable magnet can come in handy. You can reach down inside of the appliance and retract that screw that you dropped,\n instead of having to take the appliance apart just to reach it. Not only that, but it's also great for everyday things, like reaching lost toys under the\n stove, car keys from in between the seats, and removing stuck batteries. With so many uses; you can’t go wrong with gifting a magnetic pickup tool. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 5. Non-Contact Voltage Tester\n \n If this handy person in your life works on appliances or other electrical devices in the home, a handy tool to have is a non-contact voltage tester.\n These devices allow you to quickly determine whether you have power in a circuit or not. There is no need to make direct contact with the electrical\n component itself. You can typically just hold it near the item, and it will tell you whether you have power or not. This is a must-have for the toolbox!\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 6. Multi-Bit Screw/Nut Driver\n \n Another handy tool to have is a multi-bit screwdriver or nut driver. These come in a variety of configurations, but most will be a ratcheting type that\n you can use in both a forward and reverse action. There is also a standard quarter-inch hex-type bit or socket that will fit into the end. Multi-bit\n screwdrivers can differ in shape, style, ergonomics, or the type of bits it is compatible with, so it depends on what you deem as most important.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 7. Multi-Bit Set\n \n A great accompanying gift to the multi-bit screwdriver, is a set of bits. Most appliances today use a variety of screw tips, ranging from torx bits,\n Phillips bits, straight bits, hex bits, and a security-type screw. If you can find a kit that has a good selection of these, you will surely find the\n perfect match for a multi-bit screwdriver.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n 8. Compact Driver\n \n If your gift-receiver already owns a multi-bit screwdriver, or you think it might be too tedious for them, the next step up would be a power tool.\n A compact driver with a simple hex bit driver and rechargeable battery will get lots of good use and is an essential item for any DIYer.\n It is not ideal for precision drilling tasks, but it is great for jobs where the size or placement of the hole is not as pertinent, but more torque may be\n needed, such as drilling metal or dense or knotty wood.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 9. Multimeter\n \n If the person on your list does any amount of appliance repair or occasionally works on electrical circuits in the home, one of the best tools you can\n have is a multimeter. These are typically available in both a digital format or in an analog style. Either will work just fine, although we tend to prefer\n the digital ones as they are easier to read. Be sure to pick one that has both AC voltage scales, DC voltage scales, and at least an ohm reading or\n continuity tester as well.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 10. Soft-side Tool Bag\n \n Once you’ve gone out and bought some of these gift ideas, they will need somewhere to store them. We suggest a soft-side tool bag to help them stay\n organized and protect their tools. When selecting the right tool bag, consider durability, ergonomics, and mobility.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n We hope you found something to get that DIYer on your list and you surprise them with a special gift that will make their projects around the house a\n little bit easier.

We’re going to share our best tips and microwave hacks for reheating leftovers and avoiding those cold spots! Unfortunately, certain foods like those with breading or that should be crispy, are best left to the oven. Most others are fair game for nuking! This is especially useful if you meal prep or batch cook food earlier in the week.\n\n \n \n\n\nUse a Flat Dish Instead of a Bowl\n\nObviously soups or other liquid items should be heated up in a bowl or mug. But your thicker stews and solid items like pasta will benefit from being reheated on a plate. It warms food quicker and more evenly. Be sure to arrange your food in an even layer, instead of a pile in the middle.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nUse a Microwave Safe Dish\n\nThe plastic or Styrofoam takeout containers are not the best choice for reheating your leftover curry. The food should be placed in a microwave-safe bowl or plate, generally made from ceramic or glass. Don't use a dish that doesn’t have a “microwave safe” symbol. You can check if a dish is microwave-safe by doing the following test:\n\n\tFill a microwave safe mug with cold water\n\tPlace mug in the container you want to test\n\tMicrowave for one minute on high\n\n\tIf the water is hot, but the testing container cool – then it is safe\n\tIf the testing container is hot – it is not microwave safe\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nPierce Hard-Skinned Foods\n\nMicrowaves heat up food quickly (duh!), but they also heat water quickly, which results in steam. If this steam doesn’t have a way to escape, it results in exploding food. Items with a skin, like potatoes or hotdogs, are prone to such explosions. By piercing the skin before putting them in the microwave, it provides a vent for the steam to escape through. It's the same concept as poking holes in the plastic membrane on frozen dinners. A couple jabs with a fork are all that is needed to prevent a huge mess from happening.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n \nSpread Your Food In a Circle\n\nBy spreading your food out in a circle around the plate, it makes it easier for the microwaves to heat up the food evenly. The waves that heat your food are considered “short” and it is difficult for them to penetrate a big pile of food and heat it right through. That's why a ring of food around your plate will heat up quicker and more evenly, compared to if it were all placed in the center of your plate.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nCover Your Dish\n\nThis helps to retain the moisture in your food and will keep your microwave clean from splatters. If you don’t have a dedicated microwave splatter cover, you can use a piece of damp paper towel, as that also doubles as a source of moisture and a splash guard.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nPlace Your Dish to One Side of the Spinning Tray\n\nWhen the dish is placed on the outer edge of the turntable, it will rotate in a wider circle. This creates more variation in heating, which means fewer cold spots in your food. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nAvoid Pre-Programmed Time\n\nHave you ever used the “popcorn” button on your microwave, and ended up with a bag full of burnt pieces? The “reheat” button probably won’t burn your food, but you’ll likely end up with disappointing results either way. The pre-programmed timings and heat levels likely aren’t the right settings for your meal. You’re better off selecting the time and power settings manually.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStir Food Half Way Through\n\nDon’t walk away from the microwave while your food is reheating! To ensure the dish is evenly heated throughout, it needs to be stirred – every 30 or 60 seconds, depending how long it needs overall. While other methods help, stirring is the only guarantee for no cold spots.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nWhile using the microwave is a huge time saver, ensuring that your food reheats evenly is part art and part science, and may have a learning curve depending on your appliance. If your microwave could use a bit of a tune up, just search for your model number to find all the replacement parts you’ll need. Be sure to follow along with our YouTube Channel so you don’t miss any of the fun.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

We’ve all been there, and it’s not fun. Not only do you need to spend the time running the dryer again, there’s also the cost involved with the electricity or gas being used. Here at PartSelect, we love saving you time and money, so in this article, we’re sharing our best tips to keep your dryer running efficiently. If you want to take things to the next level, we’ve also put together a guide to upgrade your dryer venting.\n\n \n \n\n\nTip #1: Sort Your Clothing \n\nYou can get better dryer efficiency if you sort your laundry items by size. Keep the smaller items like undergarments separate from the larger ones like towels and sheets. For the optimal settings, you should check your dryer manufacturer’s user guide for instructions for the different kinds of laundry you’re drying.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nTip #2: Clean Your Lint Filter\n\nOne of the easiest and most important things you can do is keep your lint filter clean. All the air that goes through your dryer passes through that lint filter. If it has become clogged, it decreases the efficiency of the appliance and causes increased drying time. A plugged filter can also increase the temperature inside the dryer, could damage your clothes and the lint becomes a fire hazard. If your filter has become damaged or is missing entirely (maybe it joined the missing socks?) Then it should be replaced, as it is a vital part of your dryer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nTip #3: Maintain Your Dryer Vents\n\nEven with a regularly cleaned lint filter, some debris will still find its way into the vents. You should periodically inspect the venting at the back of your dryer and look for any signs of buildup. The type of venting material you have can also make a big difference. Flexible plastic tubing is very common, but it has ridges that can trap lint, eventually leading to a block. The plastic vents can also be quite brittle, and prone to bending and cracking. Kinks in the tubing can cause restricted airflow, which leads to a decrease in your dryer’s efficiency. We'd recommend using material besides plastic for your vents, and further down in this article we’ll share a step-by-step guide to updating your vents.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nTip #4: Maintain the Vent Caps\n\nNext, we’re going to head outside and take a look at the vent cap on the exterior of your home. There are typically two different types, either a single flap or a multiple flap, also known as a louvered flap. You want to ensure that the flaps stay closed when there is no airflow, and that they open fully and freely when your dryer is running. If there is any lint buildup, it should be removed so that the vent can work properly. If needed, you can do a thorough cleaning of your entire dryer vent system following our guide. If you have a screen or rodent protector over the vent cap, it can collect lint and debris which restricts airflow.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nTip #5: Inspect the Door Gasket\n\nThe gasket on your dryer door provides a tight seal when the door is closed, ensuring the hot air stays inside and the cooler room-temperature air stays out. If the door gasket has any tears or missing pieces, that seal is compromised and should be replaced. Having the hot air escape, or cool air getting sucked in, will impact the efficiency of your dryer and it may need to work longer or harder to dry your clothing.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nTip #6: Heating Element Care\n\nInside your dryer drum is the inlet duct assembly. The surface can become quite hot, and certain types of fabrics can melt if they come in contact with it. If material has melted onto the duct, it can create a rough surface which can further damage your other clothing. Once the dryer has cooled down, take a look at this part and clean it off if necessary.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nIf you’ve completed all these tasks, your dryer should be giving you warm, dry, fluffy laundry in an efficient manner. What if we told you it could get even more efficient, AND easier to maintain? Remember that brittle plastic venting you just cleaned wads of lint from? We’re going to show you how to upgrade to a rigid metal duct system, which will help prevent buildup, increase efficiency, and as a bonus it’s more aesthetically pleasing.\n\n \n \n\n\nThings You’ll Need \n\nRigid metal ducting, such as aluminum or galvanized material\nElbow joints (4 pieces per elbow for optimal angle adjustments)\nFoil-backed tape\nShears for cutting metal\nMeasuring tape\nLevel\nStraight edge\n\n\nUpgrade Your Dryer Vent System\n\nStep 1: Clear Your Work Area\n\nDepending on how your laundry area is set up, you may need to rearrange some things in order to complete this project. If necessary, move the washing machine out of the way, pull the dryer out so you can access the back easily, and remove all the old venting material. You may need to remove some insulation and restraints in order to access the exit port for the vent system. Keep these handy so they can be replaced once the project is finished.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep 2: Add Extensions\n\nWe want our new vent pipe to sit flush against the wall, so we needed to add an extension to the vent cap piece. Measure and cut the appropriate length of material and crimp the end so that it will fit inside the vent cap piece. Dry fit the extension to confirm that everything lines up. Once you’re satisfied, use foil tape to secure the extension in place.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep 3: Create the 90-Degree Elbows\n\nOnce again, depending on your laundry room configuration you will likely need at least two elbows to connect the new duct to the dryer and the vent cap. With our setup, we’ll require a third joint as we have quite a distance to cover. We made the elbow joints with a 4-piece galvanized elbow set that lets you adjust for the precise angle needed. Two of the elbows we created are at 90-degree angles – one will come off the extension we created in step 2, and the other will come out of the back of the dryer. Use the foil-tape to secure your elbow pieces in place. We’ll determine our third elbow angle later, once we have the main ducting in place.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep 4: Attach the Assembly\n\nFor our set-up, we used a full five-foot length of rigid ductwork. Before attaching the duct to the vent cap extension, we sealed up the seam along the back with foil-tape to ensure there are no leaks. Next is to attach the elbow to the crimped end of the duct. With the elbow taped into place, we can now attach the entire assembly to the vent cap extension. Before taping these pieces together, ensure that the long section of ducting is level. For extra security, you can use a piece of plumbing strap to attach the ducting against the wall.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nStep 5: Attach Elbow to Dryer\n\nThe second 90-degree elbow we created back in step 3 will now get attached to the back of the dryer. You will want to ensure that the crimped end of the elbow is pointing outwards so that it will fit snuggly into the ductwork.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep 6: Create Additional Elbow \n\nNow that we have the elbow attached to the back of the dryer, and our main duct pipe coming down the wall, we next need to determine what angle is required for the new elbow joint to line up with the dryer. We used a straight edge (in this case a broom handle) to determine that a shallow angle will line up perfectly with the elbow at the back of the dryer. With the angle set, you can tape up the elbow, but don’t attach it to the duct just yet.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep 7: Measure and Cut the Connecting Pipe\n\nMeasure the distance between the new elbow and the one coming out of the dryer to determine the length of pipe you’ll need to cut. You’ll need about 1.5 inches on either side to ensure there’s enough to fit inside both elbows. After marking your measurements, use the shears to cut the appropriate length. Once again, we’re going to tape up the seam running down the back of the pipe.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nStep 8: Put it All Together\n\nThis is where our whole new vent system comes together! Attach the shallow-angle elbow and the 90-degree angle elbow to your newly cut piece of pipe, and tape everything in place. Connect this new section to the pipe attached to the wall and secure it with tape. Push the dryer back into place, lining up the elbow and ensuring it’s connected to the back of the dryer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nWith the whole assembly now connected, taped, and secured it place your upgraded dryer vent system is now complete! Since it is customized to fit your exact laundry space, you will no longer experience bent, crushed, or kinks in the venting.

Follow along to find out what these components are, how to\n locate them, and how to test them. Once your refrigerator temperatures have normalized, we’ll walk you through how to make temperature adjustments based on\n your preferences.\n \n \n\n\n\nIs Your Refrigerator Getting Power?\n\nYour first step in diagnosing your refrigerator is to determine whether you have power to the refrigerator. To check this, open the door and see if the internal lights come on. If so, we know we do have power to the appliance, and now we can move on to the next step. If no lights come on this means they\n have either burnt out or the receptacle itself may have no power to it. You will want to plug in another appliance into the receptacle to verify whether you have power or not.\n \n Are the Fans and Compressor Running?\n \n The Controls\n \n Your next step will be to determine whether the fan in the refrigerator and the compressor are running. If you don’t hear any fans running, this may indicate that you have a problem with the controls. On a standard refrigerator with a dial-type control or a slide-type control, there is essentially an\n on/off switch that turns power on to the compressor and the fans. If neither of those is running, the problem is likely with the control. With models\n that use electronic controls, you’ll either need a good understanding of how those controls work or you’ll need to contact a technician to troubleshoot\n it further.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n The Start Device or Relay Overload Device\n \n If the fans on your refrigerator are running but not the compressor, it is likely a problem with the start device for that compressor. Most compressors use either a relay overload device or a start device. To get the compressor running, those components can usually be tested with a multimeter to check\n for their proper function. Without the start device working properly, the compressor may not start and therefore you would not get any cooling. Most of\n these are easily checked with a multimeter. You will just pull the device completely off the compressor to test.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Relay Start Device Components:\n \n Capacitor\n \n It may be called either a run capacitor or a start capacitor. The only thing that can be checked is whether it has shorted or not. Usually, the numbers\n on the multimeter rapidly change and then go to an overscale condition or an overload condition.\n \n Overload\n \n The purpose of the overload is to protect the compressor from starting and stopping mid-cycle with pressure built up. There should be continuity between\n the two sets of terminals on that device. One terminal that attaches to the compressor and the external terminal. They should show somewhere close to zero\n ohms.\n \n Relay\n \n The purpose of the relay portion of the device is to activate both the start and run windings on the compressor. Once the compressor comes up to speed\n the start winding will get dropped out so that it does not draw too much current. Typically, they will use some type of thermistor or varistor device\n internally. There will be some continuity between these two terminals. If there isn’t, you can assume that the device is defective. There are different\n types of relays, and the more modern ones with the electronic control boards internally can be very difficult to check with a multimeter without extensive knowledge of how that circuit works.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Inverter Drive Style Compressors\n \n Lastly, you may find that your refrigerator has an inverter drive style compressor, which would have a box mounted to the side of the compressor.\n This performs the same function as the start device with the exception that it can also operate a variable speed compressor. Again, these are very difficult devices to troubleshoot without extensive knowledge of the circuits.\n \n The Compressor\n \n The last check would be on the compressor itself. You can test the internal windings on that compressor to verify that they’re in working order.\n You’ll find three male pins on the side of that compressor. Typically, the one at the top would be the common terminal and the other two would represent both the start and run windings. Measuring between the common terminal and each of the remaining two terminals would indicate that they all have continuity.\n The start winding will generally have a higher resistance than the run winding.  You will also want to look for any continuity between the three pins and\n ground on the case of the compressor. Make sure that there is no continuity between any of those terminals. If so, the compressor is shorted and would need\n to be replaced, which would require a certified technician to do that repair.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n If both the evaporator and condenser fans are running and the compressor is running, and you are still not getting any cooling in your refrigerator, you can suspect that you have a seal system problem. That will require a qualified technician to perform a proper diagnosis.\n \n How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge\n \n Once you have the cooling back up and running, you may wonder what the best temperature is to keep your refrigerator, and how to make those adjustments based on your preferences. Continue reading for tips on making those correct temperature adjustments or check out our video below.\n \n \n\n\n\nMost manufacturers will have a recommended default setting for their models. For fresh-food temperature, that can range anywhere from 35 to 38 degrees\n Fahrenheit, and a freezer temperature anywhere from 0 to plus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. They are all adjustable to your own preference, however, we do caution\n that if you set your refrigerator controls too cold, you do run the risk of food freezing in the fresh-food compartment, also causing your refrigerator to\n run longer and use more energy. If you set your controls to too high of a setting, you also run the risk of food spoiling.\n \n There are several styles of controls to adjust these temperatures, and we’ll give you an example of these and how to adjust them for your model. Most refrigerators that have two or more doors will have two or more controls to operate them. Typically, there will be one for the freezer and one for the fresh-food compartment. On the models we show in our video as an example, one of the controls turns the compressor on and off based on its specific temperature. The other control varies how much air comes from the freezer into the fresh-food compartment.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n The controls on most fridges will either be a numbered scale, a name scale (cold, colder, coldest), or you may even find some models that display the ambient temperature in both the fresh food and freezer compartments. \n \n If your model does not have an ambient temperature indicated, but you do want to know what the temperature is, you’ll need to use a quality thermometer. Immerse it in a jar of liquid, in your fresh-food compartment or a semi-solid substance in your freezer, to get an accurate temperature.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n If you have decided that the manufacturer’s recommended settings aren’t to your preference, and have decided to make a change, keep in mind that whichever control you adjust, the fresh-food or the freezer temperature, this will affect both compartments. Also, remember that it takes about 24 hours for temperatures to stabilize in your refrigerator after you make an adjustment.\n \n We hope by following our troubleshooting tips, you were able to get your refrigerator cooling again! Don’t forget to properly set your temperature according to your preferences and use our helpful tips to ensure you don’t spoil food or freeze food in the main compartment.

To help you save some money, help the planet and consume food safely, we’re going to show you how proper food storage can make a huge\n difference!\n \n \n\n\n\nTemperature Zones in Your Refrigerator\n\nYou may typically set one control to a specific temperature inside your refrigerator, but what you may not realize is that the fresh food compartment has\n different temperature zones. Normally you will find that the upper shelves and the doors will be the warmest areas and the bottom shelves and crispers will\n be cooler. The door or doors on your fresh food compartment are going to be warmer zones. So, while it is tempting to keep items that you want easy access\n to on the doors, milk cartons and eggs should be kept somewhere else. As a rule of thumb, try placing less perishable items such as condiments on the door\n bins. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Although the upper shelves are a slightly warmer location in your refrigerator, they are also very easily accessible and an ideal spot for snacks and\n leftovers. Keep in mind that this is also the area that the cold air enters your fresh food compartment, therefore you’ll want to be sure that you don’t\n place perishable items directly in that airflow. Since cold air drops, the bottom shelves are going to be the coolest part of your refrigerator. This\n makes it the ideal location for storing such things as raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs.\n\n \n What Should I Store in my Crisper Drawers?\n \n Do you know the proper settings and which foods to keep in your crisper drawers? Most crisper drawers will have a feature that will allow you to choose\n between a low or high humidity within them. The controls are usually either a slider control or adjustable dial that you can choose between a low and high\n humidity. If your crisper drawers do not have this option, by default they are considered high humidity drawers. This is due to the lack of airflow into\n and out of the crisper.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n What Need's a Low Humidity Setting?\n \n Generally, fruit will be the main items being stored in a low humidity setting. The reason for keeping fruit in the low humidity drawer is because many\n fruits produce ethylene as they ripen, which in turn speeds up the ripening or rotting process of surrounding produce. The increased airflow in a low-humidity crisper drawer lets some ethylene gas escape.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n What Need's a High Humidity Setting?\n \n High humidity drawer items that are prone to moisture loss or welting should be stored in a high humidity crisper drawer. Items like leafy\n greens, herbs, and vegetables in general, should be kept here. Since the drawer is sealed off from the rest of the refrigerator, the produce is not\n exposed to the ethylene gas. The humid environment helps keep the produce fresh for longer, which explains the name crisper drawer.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Tips for Storing Food in The Freezer\n \n Food kept in the freezer will generally be safe to eat for months on end, as long as it has stayed frozen the entire time. The quality of the food,\n however, may diminish over time. Qualities like the color, smell, taste or texture of the food can change. Freezer burned food is still safe to eat but\n the quality will suffer the most. The best way to prevent freezer burn is to properly store the food. For example, don’t freeze meat in the original foam\n tray you bought it in. Any plastic bags or containers you use should be freezer-grade quality. Air is the ultimate enemy, so make sure lids and seals\n are airtight. If you are freezing leftovers, ensure that they have cooled completely before putting them in the freezer, as steam will create ice crystals.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n We hope learning about how to properly store food inside your refrigerator will ultimately help to limit the amount you throw out, saving you money in\n the long run! If any of the components that we’ve mentioned, such as your crisper drawers or bins become damaged, this can also impact the ability for\n them to preserve your produce, so be sure to replace components as necessary.

We’ve put together a checklist of things to inspect and clean before the heating season begins – check it out below or watch our video!\n \n \n\n\n \n Turn the Furnace on\n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\tIt’s a good idea to fire up your furnace to make sure that it starts up quickly and there aren’t any noises coming from either the blower fan or the inducer motor. \n\t\t\tTurn the heating setting on and turn the temperature up a few degrees higher than its current temperature.\n\t\t\tMake sure the power source to the HVAC system is also turned on. \n\t\t\tIf you don’t hear the heat turn on in a few minutes, you may want to take off the thermostat cover and make sure the wire connections are intact (if comfortable). \n\t\t\tIf it is still not working, you will want to check the furnace fan, blower, inducer motor, burners, or the heat pump. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tTip: Consider using a programmable thermostat if you don’t already, this will help with energy savings.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tGas Connections\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCheck the gas connections for any signs of leaks \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tElectrical Connections\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRemove the access panel for your furnace and check the electrical connections for signs of arching or corrosion, and make sure all the terminals are tight.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tThe Air Filter\n\t\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tYou will likely have an air filter behind a vent grill in the wall or ceiling, or a filter in the HVAC system itself. \n\t\t\tChanging the air filter is extremely important as it keeps particles out of your HVAC system, ensuring it runs smoothly, and safely. \n\t\t\tIf your HVAC system includes a humidifier, change the humidifier filter too.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tTip: The air filter should be inspected and cleaned or replaced at least twice during the heating season, but this will depend on the specific instructions set by your manufacturer.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tThe Duct Work\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tInspect the duct work around the furnace for air leaks and tape those up with foil tape.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tThe Blower Motor\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tCheck your owner’s manual to see if your motor is the kind that needs to be lubricated. \n\t\t\tIf it needs to be lubricated, turn off the power, clean the caps that cover the bearings, and remove the caps and lubricate the bearings. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tCheck the Air Vents\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCheck all the air vents in the home and make sure they aren’t being blocked\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tDo an Overall Clean\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tTo help prolong the life of your unit, take a vacuum, and remove any debris that has made its way in and around the furnace. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTip: Every few years you may want to consider having your duct work professionally cleaned \n\t\n\tCover the AC condenser (unless your HVAC is a heat pump)\n\t\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tCover the condenser to protect it from the outer elements (leaves, debris, icicles).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tInspect the Chimney and Carbon Monoxide Detectors\n\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tCarbon monoxide is odorless and can be fatal \n\t\t\tEvery floor should have a working carbon monoxide detector and they should be inspected to ensure they are working properly. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tBy performing these quick checks and maintenance tasks, it should prepare your furnace for the upcoming heating season and ensure your HVAC system\n\tis running smoothly!

Power outages, fallen trees blocking roads, and multiple inches of snow can make it dangerous if not impossible to leave your home during or after a storm hits. This isn’t an excuse to start hoarding (no one wants to repeat the great TP shortage of 2020), but keeping a kit of emergency supplies is also a smart idea. In this article, we’ll share our list of items to have on hand, along with some helpful tips so you can  weather the storm.\n\n \n \n\n\nSources of Water\n\nThe general rule for drinking water is to have at least one gallon per person, per day. Of course, it is impossible to know how long the power will be out for, so use your judgment on how much is an appropriate amount to store. Bottled water that is FDA approved will have a longer shelf life, so can be kept on hand for future use.\n\nWater for food preparation and sanitation will use at least another two quarts per day, per person. This water doesn’t have to be bottled; any potable source will do. If you have enough advanced notice of the storm, you can freeze containers of potable water, which can then be kept in the fridge to help keep food cool.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nToiletries and Medication\n\nAlong with water, you should have an adequate supply of personal hygiene items on hand including hand soap, toothpaste, shampoo, deodorant, and hand sanitizer. Dish soap, toilet paper, paper towels, along with towels and washcloths are other items you don’t want to run out of if you’re required to shelter in place.\n\nYou should have one week's supply of any required prescription medication, along with non-prescription drugs like antacids, pain and fever relief, or antihistamines. At this time, you should evaluate your first aid kit, and replenish any missing items.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nLighting and Communication\n\nIf you have one, dig out your battery-powered or wind-up radio, along with any spare batteries for it. This can serve as both a source of entertainment and a way to get news updates on the situation. Be sure to charge cell phones and electronic devices, but try to use them sparingly, especially if the outage is expected to last a couple of days. Portable battery packs are an extremely useful device that you should have charged and ready to go.\n\nFlashlights and camp lanterns should also be brought out of storage, and spare batteries on hand. If your lantern is fuel-powered, be sure to have an extra supply of fuel. Candles, lighters, and matches are all other sources of light to have in your storm kit.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nHousehold Items\n\nIf you have a generator, ensure that it is maintained and operating ahead of time. If it needs some work, you can read our article on generator maintenance here. Be sure that you have an adequate fuel supply on hand, but store that fuel separately – not in your generator. Another handy item to have on hand is plastic utility tarps. They have many uses, but some examples are if your roof leaks or a window breaks in a storm, the tarps can provide temporary relief until a full repair can be made.\n\nOne of the most important things to have on hand for a power outage is cash. If you do need to purchase items, stores won’t be able to process a debit or credit transaction if there is no power or internet connection. Or if the neighborhood kids come around to clear the snow from driveways, you have a way to compensate them.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nAdditional Tips\n\nIf you have advance notice of the storm, be sure that your vehicles are fueled up, along with filling an appropriate fuel storage container for your generator, if you own one. If snow is in the forecast, have shovels, salt, scrapers, and brushes ready to go. If you have a wood-burning heat source, ensure that you have an adequate supply of dry firewood. Finally, filling a tub with water gives you an additional water source, along with the ability to flush your toilet as a power outage means no water pump.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nYour household may have other items they deem necessary, but we hope this list gives you a good jumping-off point for creating your own storm preparedness checklist. If you need replacement parts for your generator, you can find them by searching for your model number.

Perhaps you remodeled the kitchen, but new appliances weren’t in the budget? Or maybe you’re selling your home and want your kitchen to sparkle? We’ll show you all the bits and pieces you need to deep clean or replace in order to make your range look good as new.\n\n \n \n  \n\nInspecting the Plastic Components\n\nThe first thing to do is inspect the plastic elements, as they’re easy to clean or replace if necessary. These include the burner knobs, the handle, and the top vent on the door. If they’re too discolored or damaged, replacing them will be easier. If they’re simply just dirty, then they can be removed from the range and cleaned up. The burner knobs are easily removed by just pulling them off the shaft. They can then be soaked in a cleaning solution and given a scrub to remove any remaining residue.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nCleaning the Backsplash\n\nWith the knobs removed, the backsplash area of the range can get a thorough cleaning using a plastic or paint-safe cleaner. When cleaning the electronic control surface, it is probably best to spray the cleaner onto your sponge or cloth, instead of directly onto the controls.\n\nFixing Up the Cooktop\n\nThe next area of focus is the cooktop. Start by removing the burner elements and drip bowls and give them a good inspection for signs of wear or corrosion on the elements. If these parts are beyond cleaning, they should be replaced. If the drip bowls aren’t in bad shape, they can be soaked in a cleaning solution and then given a good scrub. If the elements are also in good shape, a damp cloth can be used to clean them up. It should go without saying, but absolutely do not submerge or soak the burner elements. If there is some caked-on food, make a paste with baking soda and water and let it sit while you work on another part of the range.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nUsing the Oven’s Self-cleaning Process\n\nSince we’ll be removing the oven door to thoroughly clean it, we can’t use the official “self-cleaning mode” on the oven. Instead, we’re going to use a spray-on cleaner to break down the burnt-on residue. We'll leave it to work while we focus on sprucing up the other parts of the range. The racks can be removed and placed in a large bin with a cleaning solution to soak.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nRemoving and Inspecting the Oven Door\n\nThis next step will be the most labor-intensive part of the cleaning, but the oven door can get a lot of build-up so a deep cleaning will make the whole range look good as new. Check your user manual or one of our repair videos to find out the proper procedure to remove the door for your specific model. Once the door is placed on a suitable work surface, it can be examined more closely.\n\nOn our model, we noticed a significant amount of rust on the bottom strip that holds the glass in place. If you have similar issues, you can try sanding it down and repainting the strip, or you can replace it completely. The same method can be used for the two side trim pieces – once removed from the glass they can be cleaned up or replaced if necessary. With the glass removed and set aside, next is to inspect and clean the door handle and vent. They are held onto the door with a couple of screws, and once removed, the pieces can be soaked in a cleaning solution to remove any grime.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nCleaning the Oven Door Glass\n\nNext up is cleaning the various parts of the door glass. The inside door glass will likely have some heavy buildup from cooking splatters, so a razor scraper can help to remove that. With the inner door cleaned up, the door can be flipped over to the opposite side. This side shouldn’t be too dirty, as it doesn’t have any exposure, but could still benefit from a wipe down. The outer door glass can be cleaned up with a regular glass cleaner, or a more aggressive one if there is rust to take care of.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nReassembling the Door\n\nThe door handle and vent can be taken out of their soak and wiped down to get the remaining grime off. At this point, the oven door can be reassembled. The outer door glass can be reinstalled with the two side trim pieces, and the bottom trim piece securing the glass with the two clips.\n\nFinishing Up the Oven Cleaning\n\nBefore reattaching the door to the range, finish cleaning up the inside. The oven cleaner should’ve done its work by now, and any burnt-on residue should be easy to wipe up. The racks can be replaced, and the door reattached. The drip bowls and elements can be installed, and the burner knobs put back in place. With all the parts deep cleaned and reinstalled, your range should now look good as new!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nIf you need to replace any of the parts on your range, such as the burner knobs, drip bowls, elements, or door handles, we’ve got you covered!

The filter blocks dirt, dust, and debris from entering the carburetor and engine. Without the filter, all that gunk would get pulled into the internal parts of the engine, causing it to work harder, use more fuel, operate less efficiently, and eventually cause it to fail. Filters are generally made of paper, foam, or a hybrid and are designed to trap extremely small particles. It is important that you regularly inspect the condition of the filter and clean or replace it as necessary. The engine still needs air in order to operate, so while a filter helps trap debris, if it gets too clogged up it also prevents air from reaching the engine.\n\nIn this article, we’ll be talking about the symptoms of a dirty air filter and how it impacts your small gas engine. Feel free to follow along with the video, and continue reading below.\n\n \n \n \n\nIncreased Fuel Consumption\n\nIf you find your equipment is using more fuel than usual to get the same amount of work done, check to see if the air filter is dirty or clogged. Your engine has to work harder to operate since it isn’t getting the amount of air it needs. An imbalance of fuel and air can also result in black smoke coming out of the exhaust, which is another indication that the engine isn’t getting the necessary air.\n\nTrouble Starting\n\nA small gas engine needs the right amount of air, fuel, and a spark to start. If one of these elements is missing, there won’t be combustion and therefore your engine won’t start. So, if you have good fuel and your spark plug is fine, but your engine still won’t boot up, then there is an issue with getting the air. A clogged-up air filter is likely the culprit.\n\nPower Loss\n\nWhen the air filter is dirty it reduces airflow into the engine. Without the right amount of air in with the fuel, there’s less combustion and less horsepower. If you notice that your engine is surging up and down or even stops completely while operating, you once again want to check the air filter. If it is dirty or clogged, clean or replace it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nReplace Your Filter\n\nCheck with your owner’s manual for the recommended filter for your specific model. An incorrectly sized filter will allow for dirt and debris to get past, and into the internal engine components. A proper fit prevents that from happening, and purchasing an OEM part is your best bet for that.\n\nIf your equipment has a paper filter, you can gently tap it on a solid surface to remove some of the debris. Hold it up to a bright light – if the light is blocked, then it is time to replace that paper filter. Unfortunately, they can’t be cleaned, but they are easy and inexpensive to replace.\n\nIf you have a foam filter that is in good shape, it can be cleaned and put back into your equipment. However, if it is crumbling, stained, or otherwise damaged it is best to replace it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nClean Your Filter\n\nAs mentioned above, a paper filter can’t be washed, but a foam one can! Warm, soapy water, a zip-top bag, and a bit of engine oil is all you’ll need. First wash the filter in your sink or a washtub with warm water and some dish detergent, to remove the dirt and grease. Make sure it is rinsed thoroughly, squeeze out any excess water, then leave it to dry. Before you place the filter back in your equipment, it will need to be saturated with some clean engine oil. To reduce the mess, put the filter and oil in a plastic bag and work the oil into the foam. Blot up any excess oil with some paper towel, and you’re good to go.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nAs you can see, clean and properly sized air filters are an extremely important part of making sure your small engine functions efficiently!

If your freezer isn’t running efficiently, it can lead to fluctuations in temperature, which in turn can lead to damaged or spoiled food. Having a properly cleaned and maintained chest freezer is the best way to ensure the quality of your food isn’t negatively impacted.\n\n \n \n  \n\n\nStep One: Remove the Food\n\nThe first step is to remove all the food from the freezer. The food should be kept in iceboxes or coolers so that it stays cold. If you don’t have access to those, cardboard boxes will also work, but you may want to wrap them in some blankets for extra insulation. When removing items from the freezer, inspect them for signs of damage like freezer burn. Typically, there will be a layer of frost or ice crystals on the surface if the food has freezer burn. Another sign is if the food looks dried out or shriveled up.\n\nFreezer burned food is still safe to eat, but it won’t taste the same - the flavor, texture, and color will all likely have changed for the worse. To prevent future freezer burn, make sure you are properly wrapping and storing your food in the freezer. Use designated containers, bags, or wraps, and ensure that any air has been removed from the packaging. A vacuum sealer can be a great choice if you regularly freeze a large quantity of food.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep Two: Defrost the Freezer\n\nOnce the freezer has been emptied, it can be defrosted. If there is a large buildup of frost on the interior liner, you may be tempted to use a heat gun or a putty knife to scrape it off. We do not recommend you use these tools – just let it melt on its own! A hairdryer set to a low heat setting may be used to help speed up the process. A heat gun is much too powerful and will damage the interior lining of your freezer, whether it is plastic or metal. A putty knife can also damage the surface of the liner, or potentially puncture the refrigeration lines which would render your freezer useless. When any ice or frost has melted, remove the plugs and drain the water from the freezer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nStep Three: Clean the Main Compartment\n\nTo clean the interior of the freezer, simply use dish detergent and warm water with a soft scrub brush or washcloth. Start with the top area of the freezer opening, then the interior walls, and finish at the bottom. Once it is thoroughly scrubbed, it should be rinsed well with freshwater, in the same top to bottom order. Unless the food has leaked inside the freezer, this step shouldn’t require much elbow grease.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep Four: Clean the Lid Liner and Gasket\n\nNext, we’ll turn our attention to the lid liner and the gasket. Carefully inspect the gasket for any signs of deformity or damage and replace it if necessary. This will ensure your freezer door keeps a tight seal. Then look over the lid liner for any cracks, repairing or replacing if necessary. Once the lid has been inspected, it can be cleaned up. The same soap and water mixture, or a spray-on cleaner can be used here along with a soft cloth or sponge.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nStep Five: Clean the Freezer Exterior\n\nThe exterior surface of the freezer can be cleaned with the dish detergent and water solution, or with a spray-on cleaner that is safe to use on painted surfaces. Give it a good wipe down and leave it to dry.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nStep Six: Clean the Freezer Grill\n\nOn chest style freezers, there is likely a grill on the side of the freezer located next to the compressor. Give it a look over to make sure there is no debris or lint buildup. If so, it will need to be cleared out so that air can flow freely over the compressor to keep things running smoothly.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStep Seven: Turn the Freezer Back On\n\nWith all the components cleaned up, both the exterior and interior drain plugs can be put back in place. Once that is done it is safe to turn the freezer back on. The frozen items you stored in the icebox should be able to be placed back inside the freezer after it has been running for half an hour.\n\nIf you need replacement freezer parts, you can find them by searching for your model number on our site.

Depending on where you live, that may mean anything from just needing a sweater to full-on blizzard season. Regardless, a change in the season means changing up how you care for your yard. If you experience more “traditional” winters, read on to learn how to prepare your yard before the snow falls!\n\n \n \n \n\nFallen Leaves \n\nOnce the last of the leaves have fallen off your trees (and hopefully before any snow falls), give the yard a final clean-up. The raked leaves can either be added to your compost pile, or bag them up and place them at the curb. Another option is to mulch up the leaves with your mower, aiming to get them to dime-sized pieces. The mulched leaves can be left on your yard and will compost over the winter, which will make your lawn happy in the spring! Always be sure to clean up any leaves near building perimeters.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nInspect Gutters \n\nNow is the time to inspect your gutters to make sure they aren’t blocked with leaves or other debris. Clean out any of that gunk, then run your hose along the gutters to rinse them out and to check for proper water flow. If there are any cracks, sags, or loose parts in your gutters or down spouts, they should be replaced or properly secured. You can check out our video on how to properly clean your gutters by clicking here.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nClean Up Branches\n\nInspect the trees on your property for any dead or dying branches, and remove them as necessary. Excess snow or ice could cause them to break and fall onto your house, vehicles, or even a family member or neighbor. Cutting them back before this can happen will prevent any damage or injuries. Go through the yard and clean up any branches that have already fallen. Once the snow falls and covers them, they could become a tripping hazard.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nPaths and Driveways\n\nIf you have a gravel driveway or paths through your yard, topping up the gravel can help prevent mud from tracking indoors and water from pooling and freezing in low spots. If you live in a snowy region, frequent shoveling or plowing throughout the winter will cause some of that gravel to be removed. Be sure to remove any items along pathways like tools or gardening equipment, so they don’t become a tripping hazard when covered with snow. If you have patio stone walkways, check for any loose or uneven tiles, and make repairs as necessary.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nShut Off Outdoor Taps\n\nOutdoor taps or faucets should have the water shut off for the winter, to prevent any damage to the lines. Be sure to remove and drain the hose for storage. Locate and close the water shut-off valve for your exterior taps, then head back outside to open the faucet so it can drain. Once that is done, close it up tightly. If you have an irrigation system in your yard, follow the same steps above by closing the water valve, and then opening the irrigation lines so they can drain.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nStore or Protect Outdoor Items\n\nIf you followed our video on “how to make your own raised garden beds” you may be wondering what to do with them over the winter. One option is to add cold frames over the tops, which forms a greenhouse of sorts as they trap heat and moisture. Another option is to cover your beds with straw instead of a traditional mulch, as it will also act as an insulator.\n\nSmaller bushes and trees can be wrapped in burlap to protect them from winter environments. If you have smaller potted plants, they should be brought inside for the cooler months. Potted plants that are too large for inside should be placed in a sheltered location, and can also be wrapped in burlap for added protection.\n\nItems like your lawn furniture and BBQ should also be stored. If you don’t have a shed or garage for them, invest in some covers to keep them protected from the elements during the winter months.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nThese basic maintenance tips can help make sure your yard is ready for you to enjoy next spring!

Or perhaps you are looking for an inexpensive range or\n refrigerator for a camp or cottage! If you are wondering how to assess whether to snag that curbside appliance or leave it, we’ve put together some tips\n for how to make that decision.  \n \n \n\n\n\nElectric Ranges\n\nSmooth Top\n\nIf it’s a smooth top range, one of the first things to look at is the main top. Check for any signs of breakage or cracks, and if you find any, you\n will want to let that one go.\n \n Coil Top\n \n Verify that all the elements are there, and the drip holes are in reasonable shape. Check the controls on the back panel and make sure they are turning\n easily and aren’t broken off. If you do find that they aren’t working smoothly or are broken, you may want to pass on this one.\n \n The Racks\n \n Next, you will want to open the oven and verify that the racks are still in place and in usable condition.\n \n The Elements\n \n Do a visual check of the broil element at the top and the bake element at the bottom. Some models have a hidden bake element, which can be difficult to\n verify on the spot.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Refrigerators\n \n The Shelving\n \n Open the refrigerator and make sure the shelving is still in place. Do a quick check of all the bins and drawers and make sure they\n are in good condition.\n \n The Gaskets\n \n Do a quick inspection of the gaskets and make sure it is still intact, and free from mold and mildew.\n \n Keep in mind that shelving, bins, and gaskets are all components that can easily be replaced at a reasonable cost.\n \n The Machine Compartment\n \n You will also want to check the machine compartment of the refrigerator, which is at the back of the refrigerator at the very bottom where the\n compressor is located. You will want to look for a line tap valve, which is a device used to test sealed system problems. If the line tap valve is still\n attached to the tubing, you should take a pass. A line tap valve is used by refrigeration technicians to diagnose and recharge a sealed system. Once a\n repair has been completed, the valve must be removed. If it has not been removed this is a good indication that the repair failed, and they just left it\n intact.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Front-Load Washer\n \n Door Boot/Bellows\n \n Open the door and check the door boot or bellow. Check that it is in good condition, but don’t get too hung up on them because they are easily\n replaceable.\n \n Inner Basket\n \n The inner basket is the most critical thing to look at. Reach in, give it a spin. If it turns freely, that’s a good sign. If there is a clunking sound\n or excess movement, take a pass!\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Top-Load Washer\n \n There is not much that can be inspected visually for a top-load washer; however, most components are easily repairable and readily available.\n \n The Lid\n \n Check for signs of rust around the lid opening at the top and base of the machine.\n \n The Inner Tub\n \n Use your hand to move the inner tub around to ensure the suspension is not broken.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Gas Range\n \n The Racks\n \n Open the oven and verify that the racks are still in place and check the bottom of the oven for any signs of excessive rust.\n \n The Controls and Grates\n \n Make sure all the controls and grates are still in place and in good condition, keeping in mind these are components that can be replaced at a\n reasonable cost.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Dryer\n \n Exterior\n \n Make sure there aren’t any signs of excessive rust along the base or front of the unit, and if there is, you may want to pass. Also check the top and\n back of the dryer. If you see any signs of scorching due to high heat, also take a pass.\n \n Drum \n \n Open the dryer and make sure the drum turns freely. Also, check the back of the cavity to ensure there isn’t any excessive chipping on the back bulkhead\n or the drum itself.\n \n Baffles\n \n Check to make sure the baffles are still intact and in good condition, keeping in mind that they can be replaced.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Dishwasher\n \n Dishwashers are most often thrown out due to a kitchen renovation, and the dishwasher no longer fits. This gives you better odds that a curbside\n dishwasher is in good working condition.\n \n Lower Access Panel\n \n Make sure the lower access panel is still attached or inside the dishwasher.\n \n The Racks\n \n When inspecting the condition of the upper and lower racks, look for signs of excessive rust or corrosion on the tines. Although they are replaceable,\n they can be quite a little more on the expensive side, so that decision is up to you and your budget.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Next time you are scoping out an appliance left out on the curb you will know exactly what to check for. Do a quick scan of the parts outlined above\n to determine if you just snagged a good deal, or you should keep on driving. If you do decide to pick up the appliance, don’t forget that we carry millions\n of OEM replacement parts to make it look brand new again.

The cleaner your vent is the more efficient your dryer will work, saving you money\n and the environment. It is also important from a safety perspective. Lint build-up in your dryer vents also cause lint build-up inside the dryer, which is\n a serious fire hazard. You will want to inspect and clean your vents about once a year, however, if your dryer gets used more often than normal, you may\n want to clean it every six months. Follow along to our steps outlined below and be sure to check out the video for a visual of all these steps in action!\n \n \n\n\n\nStep 1: Disconnect Power and Move Dryer Forward\n\nBefore you attempt to move the dryer, you will need to disconnect the power. Now that the power is disconnected, you will want to look at the venting and\n make sure that as you move the dryer forward, you won’t do any damage to the venting. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 2: Pull the Vent off the Dryer\n \n Now that the dryer is pulled forward, you will be able to access the vent at the back of the dryer. Pull the vent off with your hands and inspect it to\n see if there’s any build-up of lint or debris in the area. You will also want to investigate the inside of the opening in the back of the dryer. Again,\n make sure there is no buildup up of lint or debris.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 3: Inspect the Inlet Grills\n \nIf you notice quite a bit of lint build-up on the inlet grills, you will want to disassemble the dryer because chances are a fair bit of lint has been pulled back into that area and somewhere near the heating source, and this could become a fire hazard. You’ll need to remove the grate and vacuum all that\n lint out.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 4: Turn the Dryer on\n \n Next, you will want to use the dryer air to force out any lint that we may loosen up when we come in from outside to clean up the ductwork. Depending\n on the type of equipment used to clean the ductwork, you may wish to add a device that prevents the brush from coming inside of the dryer. It attaches to\n the outlet duct on the back of the dryer, and then the duct gets reattached to it.\n \n To expel the loosened-up lint that we will create, you will need to turn the dryer on and force the lint out to the side of the home.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 5: Assemble the Rotary Brush\n \n One of the most common methods for cleaning a dryer duct is to use some type of rotary brush. These are very easy to access, either through a rental\n company or a local hardware store. It is a 4-inch brush that fits inside of the ductwork and can be driven with a portable drill. Depending on the method\n being used, you may want to vacuum while you are cleaning, in which case you will need to attach an adapter to the brush, vent, and vacuum. It could become\n quite dusty, so we recommend wearing a mask and eye protection.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 6: Remove the Vent Cap\n \n Before feeding the brush into the vent cap, if you have a louvered style (like the one in the video), you will need to remove that first. If you have\n a single flap, you will just need to simply lift it up and slide the brush in. If you are using a vacuum cleaner, you will need to remove the cap altogether. This is also a great opportunity to inspect the condition of the vent cap in case it needs replacing or repair. If it’s broken it could be\n causing cold air from making its way into the home or an easy avenue for a rodent to enter the home.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 7: Clean the Ductwork\n \n Now that the cap is removed, insert the brush into the ductwork. If you know the approximate length of the ductwork, you may want to attach an extension\n to create a longer brush. When connecting an attachment make sure that it is nice and secure because you do not want it coming apart while in the vent.\n You’ll want to use a set of pliers and electrical tape to ensure it is on nice and snug. Now you can attach the wand to your portable drill in a clockwise\n direction.\n \nSaveEmbed Image \n\nStep 8: Reinstall the Vent Cap and Caulk\n\nOnce you have completed cleaning out the ductwork with your rotary brush, you can reinstall the vent cap. If you are installing a new vent cap or if\n yours requires some maintenance, you may want to do some caulking around the perimeter to prevent any moisture infiltration.\n \n There you have it; those are the steps to follow for cleaning out your dryer vent. It's such a simple job and will help keep your dryer running smoothly and prevent a common fire hazard.

This is a handheld device that is used to measure electrical values like voltage, amperage (current), and resistance. In this article we’ll show you how to test common appliances parts using a multimeter, what type of test to do for different parts, and how to properly set the meter and interpret the readings. Feel free to follow along with the video, and continue reading below.\n\n \n \n \n\nBasic Styles of Multimeter\n\nThere are two basic styles of multimeters on the market today. Standard analog multimeters, which use a needle-type movement, and digital style multimeters, which use a digital display. Both perform the same functions; however, you may notice a difference in how the scales are marked.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nWith an analog meter you need to do an initial zero adjustment for continuity tests. There is an ohm scale as indicated by the ohms symbol, and a variety of settings ranging from r times 10k to r times 1, which is our preferred scale for doing continuity tests. There’s also a setting at the very bottom showing a speaker icon, which indicates that it will give an audible tone if there is continuity.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nAppliance Part Classifications\n\nMost common appliance parts can be categorized as either conductors, switches, or load devices. The testing we do for those will vary depending on the part. For conductors and switches, we typically only need to perform a continuity test to determine whether the part is defective or not.\n\nBefore testing any components, be sure to turn off, unplug, or flip the breaker to ensure there is no power supply to the appliance.\n\nHow to Test a Conductor for Continuity\n\nSome common parts that would be classified as conductors would be things like thermal fuses, wiring conductors, or wiring in general. To properly test a conductor for continuity we first need to isolate it from the rest of the circuit in the appliance. For components such as fuses we typically should remove at least one if not both wire leads that are attached to that. We next need to take our multimeter and set it to an ohms or resistance scale to perform the test. In this example, we used a thermal fuse from a range. To test it, we simply need to attach one meter lead to one of the terminals and our second lead to the opposite terminal. The reading on the meter shows close to zero ohms which indicates that there is continuity through the part.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nHow to Test Switches for Continuity\n\nSwitches are another common part that need to be tested for continuity. There are many different types of switches used in appliances, such as door and lid switches, timer contacts, relays, touchpads, and other devices. The commonality between these devices is that they will typically have a set of electrical contacts enclosed within. The contacts inside these components will either be in a typical open state or a closed state, and either the action of the user or the function of the part will determine how we check the continuity of the component.\n\nTo properly check a switch for continuity, it first must be isolated from the circuit. Next, we need to identify which terminals on the component we need to use to perform our test. With some common switches, the designations will be printed on the body of the component. A terminal may be marked with “C” for common, “NC” for normally closed, and “NO” for normally open. The common terminal and normally closed terminal should show continuity until the actuator is pressed. In that situation, the common to normally open should not show continuity until we activate the actuator of the switch.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nDifferent Types of Switches\n\nNot all switches have designations printed on them, so you may have to consult the wiring diagram for the product that you’re working on. In the above video, we show a variety of examples for testing continuity on different types of switches, such as dishwasher door switches and refrigerator lights.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nHow to Test Load Devices for Continuity\n\nNext, we’ll look at testing for continuity in load devices. Most load-type components in appliances are either constructed with coiled wire or a high resistance metallic compound. These components have a specific resistance to current flow that is measured in a unit called ohms. However, if you suspect one of these devices has failed, a simple continuity test can determine that. For our example, we used an analog meter with an r times one scale to test a burner element. A low ohm reading indicates that the component is working, whereas a high reading means the part is defective. The higher the resistance, the lower the flow of current is.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nHow to Test a Capacitor\n\nThe last device we’re going to test is a capacitor. You will often find capacitors used in motor circuits, such as in a fridge compressor or the drive motor in a washing machine. Capacitors are either a start-type or a run-type, and they build an electric charge and then can hold that charge after an appliance is turned off. Before attaching meter leads to a capacitor, you definitely want to make sure that it has been discharged – some capacitors may have a built-in discharge system. You can also use a high wattage high ohm resistor attached to your capacitor to slowly discharge it before testing.\n\nTo test your capacitor, set your multimeter at a high ohm scale and attach the two leads to the capacitor. If using an analog meter, you will see the needle move towards zero and then back to infinity. This indicates that the capacitor is able to take a charge. If the measurement came in at zero ohms or a fixed low ohms resistance, then the capacitor is defective and will need to be replaced.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n  \n\nKnowing how to test and interpret multimeter readings can help you pinpoint the problems with your appliances. This allows you to purchase the proper replacement part and get things back up and running again. If you’ve run tests and determined you need to make some repairs, simply search for your model number on our site to find genuine OEM parts.

Painting them is such a great way to give a space an updated look, and to freshen up that tired-looking refrigerator, oven, or microwave. Follow along with our steps to learn how to give your appliances a whole new look!\n\n\n\n\n \n The refrigerator we are using for this example does not have handles, so that is one less thing to worry about. However, if you are painting an appliance with handles, try painting them chrome, bronze, or gold for a trendy update. Handles are also an easy replacement if they are just in need\n of a little TLC.\n\n Steps for How to Paint Your Appliance:\n \n Step 1: Select the Paint\n \n When deciding on the paint you will use for your appliance, be sure to pick a product that is compatible with the surface that you will be applying it to, whether it is metal, plastic, or both. The color you choose is totally up to you and the style you are trying to achieve in the space. For the refrigerator we painted, we decided on a beautiful retro blue to match our coastal decor theme.\n \n Step 2: Remove the Doors and Shelving\n \n If you are painting a refrigerator (like us), you will want to remove both doors to begin. By removing both doors, you can easily tape off and isolate the interior surfaces of the refrigerator and the liners on the door. Next, remove all the interior shelving and place them away from the area where you will be painting.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 3: Clean the Interior and Exterior of the Appliance\n \n Now it is time to clean the interior and exterior of the appliance. When cleaning the surfaces that are going to be painted, we suggest using a trisodium phosphate cleaner, which is designed specifically for this purpose. For cleaning the inside of the refrigerator, we recommend just using your go-to cleanser or a simple baking soda or vinegar and water solution.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 4: Tape off the Interior\n \n The next step is to mask off the areas you do not want to paint using painter’s tape. Begin by taping off the opening of the freezer and fresh food compartments.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Next, you will need to mask off the interior with a solid sheet of paper and tape it to the inner edges.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n If the gaskets around the doors are easily removable, this will make the taping job much simpler. If the gaskets are also looking worn and dirty, this is\n a perfect opportunity to get those replaced with brand new ones. If they can’t be removed easily, you will need to tape them. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 5: Sand the Exterior\n \n If your appliance has any loose paint, chips, or rust spots, you will want to sand those out first. Next, you will want to remove the shine from the appliance, which helps to ensure the paint adheres to the surface properly. You can remove the shine by rubbing the entire surface with a 3M-style scratch\n pad.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Now take a damp cloth and wipe down the entire outer surface, ensuring any debris has been removed. Make sure you allow the surface to completely dry and then use a tack cloth to remove any remaining dust particles. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 6: Prepare the Surrounding Area for Painting\n \n We are using aerosol paint, so it is important to take the proper precautions before we begin. This job needs to be done in a well-ventilated area and surrounding surfaces will need to be protected (use a drop sheet to protect the floor). Don’t forget your safety gear! Be sure to wear a mask and shielding eyewear.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Once you have completed the first coat, you will want to apply a re-coat according to the instructions on your paint product (drying time may vary).\n When applying the second coat you will want to apply the paint in the opposite direction to the first coat. Once it is fully painted, you will want to let\n it sit for a couple of days to ensure it is completely dry and ready for use.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Now that your refrigerator has a fresh coat of paint, it is time for the big reveal.

We have put together a quick list to help you get your lawn mower up\n and running at peak performance again. Be mindful, that whenever you are performing any type of engine maintenance, that the engine needs time to cool,\n the spark plug needs to be disconnected, and it is recommended to always consult with the owner’s manual for detailed instructions for your specific\n engine.\n \n \n\n\n\nReason # 1: Too Much Oil\n\nLawn mowers require oil to avoid overheating while in use. Oil also provides lubrication, ensuring a smooth and efficiently running engine. If there\n is not enough oil, this can cause friction between parts, and this can also lead to overheating. When there is too much oil in your lawnmower it will be\n hard to start, and this will cause the engine to work harder than it needs to. This can lead to over-heating, smoking, and oil leakage. Oil leakage is\n also very dangerous, as this is a fire hazard, and needs to be rectified immediately. Check your oil level and make sure you have the proper amount.\n To avoid putting too much oil in your lawn mower, refer to your owner’s manual to know how much oil it needs to run efficiently.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Reason # 2: The Carburetor\n \n The carburetor brings fuel and air together and mixes them at the correct ratio to allow for proper combustion. If there is an issue with your\n carburetor the mixture may be off. Too little fuel could cause damage to your engine, and too much fuel could lead to carbon build-up, causing a smoking\n engine. Performing regular maintenance on the carburetor is essential for a smooth-running lawn mower. Most carburetor issues are due to a blockage from \n dirt, varnish, or gasoline deposits. Remove the carburetor and give it a good cleaning. When cleaning, be sure to target the main fuel jet (located in the \n fuel bowl nut) with carburetor cleaner and compressed air. This will loosen up any debris and should help get it back up and running properly. Carburetor\n specific cleaner dissolves deposits, which can greatly reduce premature issues. Replace any worn or damaged components, as necessary.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Reason # 3: The Air Filter\n \n Dirty air filters  are a common cause of a smoking lawnmower. The air filter has the very important job of preventing dirt and debris from reaching the\n engine and ensuring the proper airflow that it requires to run properly. After a while, dirt and debris can plug up the air filter and restrict the amount\n of air delivered to the engine. Not enough air means too much fuel, which could be causing the engine to smoke. The air filter is a high-wear part that\n should be removed and cleaned or replaced at least every three months to keep your lawn mower running smoothly. Replacing the air filter is generally a\n very simple repair that should only take a few minutes to complete. For most lawn mowers, you will need to remove the air filter cover, and just pull it\n out by hand, line-up the new air filter to the base, and reassemble the cover. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Reason # 4: Piston Rings\n \n Piston rings are what form the seal between the piston and the cylinder wall. If either of these components becomes worn, oil can leak past the rings\n into the combustion chamber. This will cause your engine to smoke. To avoid this, make sure your air and fuel filter are clean. If they are dirty or\n missing altogether, dirt can find its way into the combustion chamber, wearing away the rings and the cylinder walls. Also, check your oil. Dirty or low \n oil levels won’t lubricate the engine properly, leading to piston and cylinder wear.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n By performing these regular inspections, cleaning, and replacements, it will save you from having to make much more serious and expensive repairs down\n the road.

We’ll show you a few examples of how to release the door lock to allow you to use your range again, and possibly figure out what exactly went wrong.\n\nFollow along with our video or continue reading below!\n\n \n \n \n\nHow Does a Self-Cleaning Oven Work?\n\nA self-cleaning oven uses high temperatures (much higher than any you’d use to cook with) to carbonize any crust or spills and turns them to ash. The cleaning cycles can last from two to four hours, and as a safety precaution, the oven door is locked until the unit has cooled down. This is to prevent anyone from opening the door and being exposed to the high heat (around 900 degrees Fahrenheit!). Your self-cleaning range will either have a manual lever or a motorized device that will lock for you. Once the oven has cooled down completely, the ash can be wiped up with a damp cloth or even with your vacuum cleaner.\n\nQuick Fixes\n\nSo, what happens if the range has cooled down, but your door still won’t open?\n\nThe first and easiest thing to try, is turning your range off and then back on again, with the hopes that the locking system resets itself.If that doesn’t work, you can also try starting and then canceling a new self-clean cycle, to see if that tricks the door into unlocking.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nMechanically Disabling the Door Lock\n\nIf the turning it off/on methods don’t work, the next step to try is mechanically disabling the door lock. To do this, we’ll need access to the back panel, so the range will have to be pulled out away from the wall. Be sure that the power is disconnected before attempting this repair. Next is to remove the back panel and locate the door lock assembly. In the model we used in the video, there is a metal rod that goes underneath the main top, which connects to the hook that holds the door closed. In order to remove the hook, we first will remove the screws and lift the motor and bracket assembly away, which will allow us to push the rod in far enough to mechanically unlock the door. Before putting the appliance back together, be sure to check that you can in fact open the door to your oven.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nWhile you have access to the back panel, you may want to test the continuity of the door lock switch.\n\nHow to test an oven door lock switch with a multimeter:\n\n\nUnplug your oven before testing.\nLocate and remove the switch in order to test for continuity.\nSet your multimeter to Rx1 and ensure the switch is turned to the “clean\" position. Using the probes, touch the terminals of the switch, this should produce a reading of zero or nearly zero.\nIf your test results show that there is no continuity, you will need a replacement door lock switch.\n\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOpen a Manual Lock\n\nIf your self-cleaning oven uses a manual door lock, unlatching that is a different situation. If you have a coil top stove with a mechanical lock, that is the easiest one to disable. It simply requires lifting the top to access the latch mechanism and disabling the lock. Before attempting this repair, ensure that the entire appliance has cooled down so it can safely be touched.\n\nIf you have a flat-top stove, unlocking the latch takes a bit of MacGyvering. Normally you would get to the latch by opening the oven door to unscrew the top off the oven. However, since our issue is the door is locked shut, this obviously won’t work. To bypass this, you will need to make a hook out of a wire coat hanger. Slide it between the oven door and the latch, being careful not to scratch up your range, and pull the latch open. Be sure that the power is disconnected to the range before trying this.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nBuy Replacement Parts\n\nIf you’ve determined you need new parts for your oven, such as a replacement door switch, we have you covered!

Feeding & FertilizingWhen Should I Fertilize my Lawn?As summer comes into full swing, we can expect some harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and a lack of precipitation. These conditions can easily\n stress your lawn, but there are ways to keep it looking its best throughout the summer months. If you are wondering how you can keep your lawn looking lush and green all summer, follow along to these tips we’ve put together, including tips for watering your lawn, treating weeds, mowing tips, and how to feed\n and fertilize your lawn through the hot summer months.\n \n \n\n\n \n 1. Watering Your Lawn Efficiently\n \n How Much Water Does my Lawn Need?\n \n Watering your lawn regularly can have a big impact on its health. Summer lawns require at least one inch of water every week or more if it has been\n extremely hot. Try leaving a tin can outside and track the amount of water the lawn receives from the rain, that way you can better keep track of how much your lawn requires without over or under watering it. Try not to over water your lawn because this can cause harm. Allow the surface\n to dry out (at least one inch of soil), and this will prevent fungal disease and weeds. This also promotes grass with deep roots, which also helps to\n prevent damage caused by drought.\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \n When Should I Water my Lawn?\n \n The weather is constantly changing, but one thing for certain in the summertime, is that precipitation can be few and far between and unpredictable. This makes watering your lawn particularly important. It is also important to water efficiently, to reduce wasted water, and you never know if the government might impose water restriction if there is a long stretch of drought.  \nTry watering your lawn during cooler parts of the day. The hottest part of the day is usually around noon and into mid to late after noon (11AM-3PM). It is best to water very early in the morning (before 10AM). This will ensure the water isn’t quickly absorbed by the sun and has time to absorb what it needs. Watering earlier in the day also prepares the grass for the extreme temperatures later in the day by keeping the blades stronger and under less stress. Avoid watering in the evening because water that is left unabsorbed for too long can increase the chances of fungal disease. By watering earlier in the day this gives your lawn plenty of time to absorb the water.  \n\n \nSaveEmbed Image\n \n 2. Treating Weeds\n \n Avoid Harsh Chemicals\n \n When weeding your lawn try to avoid any harsh chemicals that can potentially cause more damage to your already stressed lawn. Instead, when removing weeds, do it\n by hand and fill the holes with grass seeds. This will ensure you are pulling the entire root and filling it in with future growth. Keep in mind, that if\n you do end up using weed control products, the temperature must be below 85 degrees Fahrenheit for at least two days. The best way to get rid of weeds is maintaining a lawn that makes it difficult for them to grow and thrive. Low-mowed grass, compacted soil, and water deprivation, are all factors that will encourage weed growth. Maintaining a consistent lawn maintenance schedule will help to combat those undesirable weeds.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 3. Properly Mowing Your Lawn\n \n Keep Your Mower Blade Sharp\n \n Always keep your mower blade sharp. This allows for an even and clean cut. Dull blades are more likely to rip the lawn as opposed to cutting, which can cause\n stress on the grass. Sharpen your blade at least twice a year, once at the start of the season and than again mid-way through the season. If your blade\n is damaged, it’s an easy replacement, and should be repaired right away.\n \n Mow Regularly and Keep Your Blade Height High\n \n Mow regularly and keep your mower blades as high as you can, typically around three to four inches, never cutting more than one third of the grass\n blade at a time. This prevents clippings from smothering the grass and keeps your lawn looking good. A higher grass height also means that the individual\n grass blades have more surface area for photosynthesis to occur, resulting in more growth, a better root system, and a healthier lawn.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\n4. Maintaining a Clean Yard\n\nDuring the winter and spring months, leaves, sticks and other debris can make their way onto your lawn and over time they can start to decay. Remove all\n winter debris and keep your lawn clear throughout the summer months. Clearing out debris is important because it gets rid of bugs, fungus and diseases\n that may have gathered over the summer and fall. Removing leaves from your lawn also allows your grass to breath and grow roots that will last through\n the winter. This is especially important in the fall months before the snow hits. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 5. Feeding & Fertilizing\n \n When Should I Fertilize my Lawn?\n \n This should be done early in the summer. It is best to practice fertilizing about 30 days before your areas summer temperatures arrive. Fertilizing\n during the heat of summer can damage your lawn and encourage new growth that cannot survive the summer heat. When applying the fertilizer with your spreader, start at one end of your lawn. Be careful when overlapping, as you want to avoid double dosing the\n lawn.\n \n  SaveEmbed Image\n \n We hope these tips help keep your lawn looking green and lush all summer long!

To keep your grout looking new and fresh you should be doing a regular cleaning at least once a week. In high humidity areas it is\n important to control the dampness, especially in bathrooms, using either a bathroom fan or dehumidifier. We also suggest using a grout sealant to help protect your grout and keep it lasting longer, especially after repairing or doing a thorough clean. Follow along to our video below or try our easy-to-follow 8-step process outlined in this article.\n\n\n\n\n \n How to Clean Tile Grout\n \n To clean grout you can either purchase a commercially made product designed specifically for the type of grout you have or try a homemade solution using products found around the house. For more mild staining or for regular upkeep, we suggest using a simple one-part water and one-part vinegar solution. For more stubborn stains, our tried-and-true solution includes baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and dish soap.\n \nDIY Grout Cleaner\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1/2 cup baking soda\n\t\t\t1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide\n\t\t\t1 tsp of dish soap\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tMix this solution well, apply it to the grout, let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes, and then clean it gently with a bristle brush. There are brushes made specifically for cleaning grout, or you could simply use a toothbrush. Once you are done cleaning, rinse it with water and then wipe dry with a\n\tsponge.\n\t\n\tHow to Repair Grout\n\t\n\tIf your grout is extremely dirty or is damaged, you will need to repair it. Grout repair is an easy process and a budget-friendly way to give your floor a fresh new look. \n\t\n\tMaterials Needed for Grout Repair\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tProtective gloves\n\t\t\tProtective eye wear\n\t\t\tGrout cleaner\n\t\t\tGrout saw\n\t\t\tSponge\n\t\t\tGrout float\n\t\t\tClean towel \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tStep One: Clean the Grout\n\t\n\tGive the grout a good cleaning using the solution and steps provided above to ensure the proper color match. This is especially important if you \n\tdon’t have any grout leftover that was originally used on the floor.\n\t\n\tStep Two: Remove the Old Grout\n\t\n\tNext, you will need to remove the old grout using a grout rake or saw. Be careful when using the grout rake, as you don’t want to damage the edge of the tile. Use the appropriate size rake or saw for the size of grout. Once you’ve removed all of the grout using the rake, use your vacuum to remove all the loose dust. \n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tStep Three: Clean the Area \n\t\n\tUse your damp sponge to thoroughly clean the area, removing any left-over grout residue. Be sure to follow the instructions specific to the type of grout you are using. With most cement-based grouts you will want to dampen the area before applying the new grout. For an epoxy-based grout, the area needs to be dry, so make sure it dries completely before applying the new grout.\n\t\n\tStep Four: Mix the Grout\n\t\n\tIf you have a large amount of grout to apply and need more than one package, be sure to dry mix those thoroughly before adding any water, ensuring the proper color match. Mix the grout according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tStep Five: Apply the Grout\n\t\n\tApply the appropriate amount of grout along the grout line, depending on the size of the area, working in small sections at a time. Take your grout float and work the grout into the crevasse until it is filled completely. Once it is filled in, take a rounded stick or your fingertip and run it down\n\tthe grout line to smooth it out.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tStep Six: Wipe Excess Grout from the Tile\n\t\n\tUsing a lightly dampened sponge, wipe away any remaining grout from the tile. Be careful not to use an overly wet sponge, as this will damage the grout. Allow the grout to dry for about 30 minutes. You may notice a little bit of a haze left on the tile, which can just be wiped away with a damp sponge. \n\t\n\tStep Seven: Allow the Grout to Set\n\t\n\tNow allow the grout to set, according to the manufacturer's instructions. \n\t\n\tStep Eight: Apply Grout Sealer\n\t\n\tGrout sealer is a very important step and helps to minimize the rate that moisture will penetrate the grout, making it so it doesn’t get as wet, and is able to dry more quickly. It also provides a barrier against microbes like mold. \n\t\n\tFully cover the grout in sealer and wipe up excess. Allow it to dry for 60 to 90 minutes before applying a second coat, and then allow it to fully\n\tdry for about 24 hours before it encounters any kind of moisture. \n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tThis is such an easy, efficient, and budget-friendly way to refresh old, damaged, or extremely dirty grout, giving your space a brand-new feel! \n\tFor more tips and trick for around your home, check out our YouTube Channel.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Being prepared ahead of time helps to ensure you won’t be left in the dark should the power go out. Keeping the components of your generator well maintained will make sure it starts when you need it, and helps to keep it running for the long term. Follow along in our video, and continue reading below.\n\n \n \n \n\nCheck the Battery\n\nIf you have a larger generator, you likely have a battery assist to get it started. You’ll want to make sure that your battery is fully charged at all times, and that may involve putting it on a battery charger on a regular basis. To verify that your battery is working properly, a simple way to test is by trying to start your generator. If it doesn’t turn over easily or won’t turn over at all, you’ll want to look at the battery. The first thing we’ll inspect is the cables to make sure that they’re tight, with no signs of damage or corrosion. If they seem to be fine, next is to check with a voltmeter to ensure the proper output of voltage. If you aren’t getting the desired reading, the next step is to try charging the battery. If it is not holding a charge, then it will need to be replaced. This is important to do so that your generator does not let you down when you need it the most.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCheck the Engine Oil\n\nAfter inspecting the battery, the next area we’re going to look at is the engine oil. Most modern generators now have an oil level sensor. If your oil is too low, the generator won’t start. It's important that the oil level is checked to begin with, especially if you use your generator regularly. You should follow the manufacturer's recommendations on how often you should change the oil, but typically it should be done at least once a year.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCheck the Fuel System\n\nNext, we are going to look over the fuel system. With any gasoline generator, it is critical that you do not store fuel in the tank. You should always keep fresh premium-grade fuel on hand, but never store it in the tank. The fuel tank itself should be inspected to make sure it is in good condition, and that there is no sediment on the bottom. If your model doesn’t have an inline fuel filter, it probably has a filter that fits into the opening, which you’ll want to remove and inspect. With that out of the way, check the inside of the tank for any signs of corrosion. The next area to inspect is the fuel lines going to the carburetor. Ensure that they are in good shape – they aren’t cracked or corroded or leaking. If you see any indication of these, you’ll want to replace the lines.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCheck the Air Filter\n\nThe air filter protects the engine from dirt and debris, so it is important to ensure that your filter is inspected and cleaned regularly. If the filter needs cleaning, it can simply be washed with warm soapy water, rinsed well, and left to dry. The foam style of filter needs to be saturated with clean engine oil and any excess wrung out before being reinstalled. If the filter is damaged, it will need to be replaced.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCheck the Recoil Starter\n\nThe next step is to check the recoil started. The cord will need to be inspected to make sure it’s not frayed or damaged, and to make sure the knot at the end is secure. If there is any damage to the cord it will need to be removed from the starter and replaced.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCheck the Spark Plug\n\nThe last thing on the engine to look at is the spark plug. First, locate the spark plug wire and pull that off the end of the plug. The cap will need to be inspected for any signs of corrosion. If there is any, it will have to be serviced. Then inspect the spark plug itself for excessive wear or corrosion, and if there is any it will need to be replaced.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nCheck the Electrical Connections\n\nWith all the main components of the engine looked over, next is to inspect the electrical connections. Once again, look for any signs of corrosion in the connections going to the fuel solenoid and the starter. They will either need to be repaired or replaced if damaged.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nTest the Generator\n\nBefore finishing up, add a bit of fuel to the generator and start it up to make sure it is running smoothly. Plug something into one of the outlets to verify it’s working fine. Then it can be shut down, the fuel drained, and stored until needed.\n\nIf you need any replacement parts for your generator, just search for your model number on our site.

If the blades on your mower are dull, they aren’t going to be able to cleanly cut through the grass. Instead, they will pull up on the grass, causing damage and making your yard look unkempt. Keeping your blades sharp and balanced will ensure that the grass is being cleanly sliced through at an even height, which helps keep your lawn healthy and the envy of the neighborhood.  In this article, we’ll discuss four different methods for sharpening your lawn mower blades, and how to check that they’re balanced. Follow along with the video and continue reading below.\n\n \n \n \n\nUsing an Axe File\n\nThis is the simplest and most economical way to sharpen your mower blades. This method requires you to mount the blade firmly in a bench vise. If there are any burrs or chips in the top side of the blade, we’ll be able to see those and remove them first by using the coarse side of the axe file. Next, we’ll concentrate on the bevel side of the blade. If your blade isn’t chipped too badly, you can use the finer side of file, making sure to get the angle exactly the same as the bevel. Then use strokes from the cutting edge of the blade towards the back side. Be sure to only file off as much as you need to achieve a nice sharp edge.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\nUsing a Lawn Mower Sharpener\n\nThis method uses a specific grinding wheel for a drill. This style of mower blade sharpening disc is available at most hardware stores and features a beveled edge and a guide disc that it’s mounted on.  They will fit any quarter-inch drill or larger, and the wheel is also reversible. Once one side starts to wear you can remove it, flip it over, and have a fresh surface to work with. To sharpen the mower blade, place it in your bench vise so that it is secure. We’ll use the guide on the back side of the blade and allow the beveled grinding wheel to follow along the contours of the bevel on the blade itself. Take note of the direction that the wheel is traveling as we don’t want to allow it to pull away. We are going to pull it towards us, once again only removing as much material as needed to get the blade sharp. This method is a very simple way to get the proper bevel on your mower blade every time.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\n\nUsing an Angle Grinder\n\nSince an angle grinder turns at a much faster speed, it’s important to make sure you’re wearing the proper PPE, especially eye protection. Once again for this method, the mower blade will be secured in your bench vise. When using the angle grinder to sharpen the blade, you want to make sure that the direction of the grinding wheel is going from the sharp edge of the blade to the back edge, making sure you’re following the bevel angle.  Mulching style blades typically have two cutting edges, so it can be a bit difficult to get the transition edge sharpened. If needed you can use a file for that particular spot, or gently pivot the angle grinder to access it. Once again, don't take off any more material than is needed to get that sharp edge.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nUsing a Bench Grinder\n\nThe previous methods all required securing the blade in a bench vise and using handheld tools to do the sharpening. This time we’re going to use a stationary grinder, whether it’s mounted to your floor or a bench, and we’ll move the blade itself along the grinding wheel.  It’s important that you have a tool rest to sit the edge of the blade on. Once again, we’re going to grind from the sharpened point of our bevel to the backside of the blade, only removing the absolutely necessary amount of material to get that fresh edge.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nBalance the Blade\n\nWhile it’s important to get a nice sharp edge on our blade, it’s also important that it is properly balanced. The blades become unbalanced if you shaved off more metal from one side versus the other. Keeping them balanced ensures that not only will your lawn stay better maintained, but also helps the mower itself. If the blades are unbalanced, the speed at which they’re spinning can put too much stress on your mower. There are a couple of ways to check if your blades are properly balanced. The first is simply hanging the blade from a nail in the wall. If one side is heavier than the other, it will tip downwards. The second way is to purchase an inexpensive balancing cone. Similarly, you rest the center of the blade on the cone, and the heavier side will dip towards the ground. To correct an imbalance, carefully shave off some metal from the heavier side until it hangs evenly.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nBuy New Lawn Mower Parts\n\nWe hope you found these tips helpful and that you’ll be able to implement one of these methods to keep your mower’s blades sharp!

Whether you have one propane cylinder that you refill as needed, or you always have a backup ready to go, we want to share our tips for safely transporting, storing, and using propane. Follow along with Steve in the video and continue reading the article below.\n\n \n \n  \n\nThe Validity of Your Propane Tank\n\nAll tanks are stamped with a date code, typically found on the collar at the top of the tank. Depending on your location, your tank may have a ten-year lifespan, which can usually be recertified for a further ten years. Be sure to check the date on your tank to make sure that it is still valid and able to be refilled.\n\nNext is to check the condition of your tank. If there is a lot of rust, particularly around the base, you should probably consider getting a replacement. If there are any issues, such as any severe dents or damage to the valve area, you will definitely want to replace your cylinder.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRefilling Your Cylinder\n\nIn order to refill your empty cylinder, you’ll have to transport it to a local filling station. When transporting your cylinder, you need to ensure that it stays in an upright position, that the valve is securely closed, and that the outlet of the tank has its protective cap in place. Next, you’ll need to make sure that your tank is stable. If you’re unable to strap it in place, we suggest putting it in a container that won’t allow it to tip over. One of the most common storage containers is a plastic milk crate – the tanks fit in there nice and snug which keeps it stable and upright.\n\nPropane should never be transported in an enclosed vehicle. Therefore, you should not put it in your car’s trunk unless you can keep the hatch open. If you have an open back in a pickup truck, it’s perfectly fine so long as you can keep the cylinder stable and upright. If you do need to transport it in your car, simply put it in a suitable container and sit it on the passenger floor. Make sure that the windows are open, and you’ll be good to go. It should go without saying, but you should never smoke near a propane tank.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nStoring Your Propane Cylinder\n\nYour propane cylinder should always be stored outside and off the ground, on a non-flammable base. We find that a cement-type patio stone works best for this. Always make sure that the valve is tightly closed whether it is a full or empty tank, and that you keep the valve protected. This means that you can’t stack your cylinders, as this could damage the valves. You may think that it’s fine to store your cylinders in your shed or garage over the winter, but they need to be kept outdoors.\n\nUsing Your Propane Cylinder\n\nWhen using your propane cylinder, whether with your grill, fire table, or gas fire pit, you want to make sure that it is stable and securely mounted. Most barbeques will have a device to secure the tank to the base, which prevents it from tipping over. If you’re using it with a fire pit, you may want to pull out the milk crate again to keep the tank stable.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nWhen connecting the cylinder to your equipment, you will typically attach the regulator directly to the valve on your tank. You need to make sure it’s line up properly and that you tighten the fitting securely. You can check for any leaks using a soapy water solution. If gas is leaking, the soap will bubble at the location. If you detect any leaks, you can recheck your connection and tighten them if necessary. If you still have a leak, then either your tank or your regulator assembly will need to be replaced.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nWe hope these tips make you feel more secure about handling your propane cylinder. With proper usage and storage, you can get many years of use out of your tank. If you need any replacement parts to keep your appliances running properly, you can find them by entering your model number.

HammersFeatures to Consider+2. Tape MeasureFeatures to Consider:+3. Stud FinderConsider Electronic Stud Finders+4. ClampFeatures to Consider:+5. LevelFeatures to Consider:If you are looking to try new DIY repairs and projects around your house, you might wonder the best place to start when it comes to collecting tools\n for your tool kit. Or perhaps you have a friend or family member that loves DIY and you are wondering what to buy them for their birthday, Christmas,\n Mother’s Day or Father’s day. We’ll take you through five hand tools that every DIYer should own, and how they will make your life easier.\n \n \n\n\n \n 1. Hammers\n \n This is such a versatile tool and so important for even the smallest projects around the house, from hanging pictures, nail pulling, assembling\n furniture, to larger projects like installing laminate flooring. Hammers are a must. There are a ton of different types of hammers, but we suggest sticking to an all-purpose hammer for around the home, which can be a traditional hammer or a more modern design. \n\nFeatures to Consider\n\nWhether you choose a more traditional hammer or a modern one, we recommend keeping four important design features in mind when evaluating which hammer you should go with.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMedium weight\n\t\t\t16-20 ounce head\n\t\t\tRip claw\n\t\t\tNon-wooden handle\n\t\t\n\t\nModern Hammer Design Features:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWide face\n\t\t\thatchet-style handle\n\t\t\tAnti-vibration design\n\t\t\tNon-wooden handle\n\t\t\n\t\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 2. Tape Measure\n \n This feels like an obvious one. There are not many projects that don't require a measuring tape, so you can add this to the essential list for\n all DIYers. Not to mention, tape measures have a bunch of hidden uses and features that you may not be aware of, such as using it to draw straight\n lines or magnetic tape measures that make it easy to pick up nails. There are so many different varieties of tape measures, even glow in the dark! \n\nFeatures to Consider:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAccuracy - look at how the scale has been printed on the blade and if it is easily readable\n\t\t\tErgonomics - how it feels in your hand, comfort and ability to easily use features\n\t\t\tLocking mechanism - it should be easy to lock the blade in position, and it should stay in position until it is released\n\t\t\tBlade return - is smooth and easy to control\n\t\t\n\t\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 3. Stud Finder\n \n Stud finders are a no-brainer. A magnetic stud finder helps to find studs in the wall with the movement of magnets and its strong attraction.\n It is commonly used to place the framing studs behind the wall surface, particularly drywall. They are also used for non-professional home repairs\n and installations. Without it you would not be able to hang shelves, mirrors or pictures. There are several different types of stud finders on the market, so we will help you weed through some of the important things to consider.   \n\nConsider Electronic Stud Finders\n\nSome people believe magnetic stud finders to be a thing of the past. Electronic stud finders are very easy to use and allow you to find studs with even more accuracy. Whole stud finders allow you to locate an entire stud, providing you with the location of the edges and middle, and are very popular with people in construction, but have a more expensive price tag. Many do-it-yourselfers like electronic edge finders because they are perfect for simple projects like hanging pictures and mounting objects.\n\nElectronic Stud Finder Features:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAccuracy - able to find the center of a stud in a wall, removing the guess work when using a magnetic type\n\t\t\tDigital display - more clear, easy to read, and can provide additional information\n\t\t\tScanning mode - measuring different depths, finding electrical wires, metal finders for pipes, or other hazards\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThere are so many extra features to consider, but most come with a price tag, so it depends what your priorities are and your budget!\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n\n4. Clamp\n\nOften times, DIYers are doing projects solo, and without the convenience of an extra hand, and this is where the clamp comes into play. They are a\n very versatile tool and serve to hold objects firmly in place as you work. There are a variety of clamps on the market, including C-clamps, pipe-clamps, and handscrew-clamps. For common jobs around the house, a C-clamp should be all you need. C-clamps have a jaw in the shape of the letter C, are bigger in size, and have a fixed jaw on one end and another on a tail slide that moves up and down length-wise.\n\nFeatures to Consider:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThroat depth\n\t\t\tClamping mechanism\n\t\t\tWeight of clamps\n\t\t\tClamping pressure\n\t\t\n\t\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n 5. Level\n \n Last, but certainly not least, the level. They are used to determine if a surface is level or vertical. They are essential when hanging kitchen\n cabinets or trimming a door, or simple tasks like hanging mirrors, pictures or artwork. The most basic is the spirit level, which indicates you are\n level with a bubble inside a liquid-filled vessel. If you want to one up this, there are also laser tools, which are perfect for layout work,\n but they are not great if you need to physically check the positioning of an object. When looking for the perfect level, you will want to consider what you will be using it for. \n\nFeatures to Consider:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLength - especially if you are working with lumber, doing paving projects or drywall; a long level will provide better measurement and can double as a straight-edge\n\t\t\tMagnetic levels - allow for hands-free use on metal surfaces\n\t\t\tCross-check level - for measuring horizontally and vertically at the same time\n\t\t\tDigital levels - easy to read and can provide additional information\nLine levels - measuring strings\nPost levels - for plumb posts\n\t\t\n\t\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \n These are the perfect hand tools to get you or your favorite DIYer started, but there are so many others to add to the list! We hope this helps\n to narrow down some of the handiest tools to add to your tool kit and makes your next job a little easier.

You interact with them each time you put clothes into your dryer, but perhaps you never knew their proper name. The baffles are the sets of “fins” inside your dryer drum, there are usually three or four of them spaced around the interior. They help with the airflow and to fluff up your clothes while the dryer is tumbling. They do this by lifting clothes off the side of the dryer and into the airflow. If you didn’t have baffles in your dryer, your clothes would stay clumped together and would not dry thoroughly. If they become loose or damaged, it’s possible that your clothes will get caught or snagged by them.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nSometimes after heavy use or drying items like footwear the baffles may become loose or dislodged from the drum. It's important that you address that situation as soon as possible so that you don’t do permanent damage to your drum or to your clothing. If you see that one of your baffles has become loose or is starting to vibrate it’s time to check it out.\n\nAlthough the dryer we’re demonstrating on may not be the same model as yours, the process for inspecting and replacing your baffles should be similar. Be sure to disconnect the power supply to your dryer before beginning any repairs, and if it is gas heated, also disconnect the gas supply. You can follow along with the video below to see how we did this repair.\n\n \n \n\n\nRemove Parts to Access Drum\n\nFirst, we need to open the dryer door to access the hinges. Remove the screws holding the hinges to the body of your dryer and lift on the door to remove the whole piece from your dryer. Set the door in a safe spot out of the way of your work area. Then we’ll need to remove the screws that hold the front panels in place. With those out of the way, we can then access the mounting brackets for the main top. Once those are removed, we can lift the top of the dryer which now gives us access to the outer side of the drum.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe Baffles: Inspect, Remove, Replace\n\nWith the main top now raised, we can rotate the dryer drum until the damaged baffle in question is at the “top” of the dryer. From the outside of the drum, we can remove the screws that are holding the baffle in place. If the baffle has just become loose, all you need to do is tighten up the screws. However, if the baffle is damaged or has broken off completely, you will need to replace it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIn our case, we discovered that the screw-holes were stripped, and we would not be able to re-tighten our baffle to the drum. To remove the baffle, you’ll need to use one hand to support the baffle inside the dryer (to keep it from falling and potentially damaging the drum) and remove the two screws from the outer drum. At this point, you should inspect the other baffles in the dryer for damage or to tighten them up. If the holes on the drum have any damage, you’ll need to use a larger washer when replacing to ensure they stay nice and tight.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nClose Up The Dryer\n\nOnce you have inspected, replaced, and tightened up each of the baffles in your dryer, it is time to put the appliance back together. Carefully lower the main top, ensuring it clicks into place. Reinstall the mounting brackets and front panels and reattach the door to the hinges. Be mindful of the status of your baffles, staying on top of any loose ones so that your clothing doesn’t become torn or your dryer damaged. Try to avoid drying large clunky items like sneakers, as these can cause the baffles to crack or break.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf you need to purchase replacement parts for your dryer, we have thousands of genuine manufacturer approved parts available on our website you can find by searching for your model number.

There are many options out there, so finding the right solution for your home can be a tough decision. The size and shape of your home along with your budget are just a couple of the factors to take into consideration. In this article, we’re going to look at four different types of air conditioning systems, and the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nWhen you are shopping around for a new air conditioner, you need to look at more than just the purchase price. When making our comparisons, we thought about these five factors:\n\n\n\nEnergy efficiency\nEase of installation\nCost (both upfront and operating)\nMaintenance requirements\nNoise while operating\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nPortable\n\nA portable air conditioner is easy to set up, can be used with most types of windows, and is generally affordable to purchase. Another perk is in the name: these units are portable and many are on caster wheels so they can be moved from room to room. For example, maybe you work from home so you can set up the AC in your office during the day, then move it back to the bedroom at night. However, these units are also the least efficient and the noisiest. They are also quite heavy (50 – 80 lbs.), so if you’re trying to roll it over carpet or stairs it may be difficult to maneuver. When it is no longer cooling season, you will also need additional storage space for the unit. Maintenance is easier, as the unit sits on your floor instead of hanging out the window, and it’s important to keep all filters and coils clean and free of debris. These units typically have a shorter lifespan (5 – 10 years) even with regular maintenance. Portable ACs will absolutely help to keep you cool, and we'd recommend this type if you’re renting and unable to install a window or wall unit.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWindow\n\nA window AC unit is another temporary option, but with many more advantages over the portable units. Similarly, they have lower upfront costs, are easy to install, and easy to maintain. However, compared to a portable unit, they are much more energy efficient (many are Energy Star rated), have a longer lifespan (10 – 20 years), and are a bit quieter since a portion of the unit is outside the house. The disadvantage to this style is that you will need to install and remove the unit with the seasons, and have a place to store it in the winter. They also don’t work with every type of window, like casement windows. They tend to work best in double-hung, however verticle models are available for slider-style windows. Larger units can be more difficult to install due to their weight, so keep this in mind if your room has a lot of square footage to cool.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDuctless Mini-Split\n\nDuctless mini-splits are a great option if your home does not have ductwork already, and you want a more permanent option than a window or portable unit. They generally have a few different operating modes including cooling, heating, dehumidify, and just a fan. These types of units have an outdoor condenser/compressor and the indoor evaporator/head of the unit. Multiple heads can be attached to the one outdoor condenser, so you can have more than one room or zone being cooled. For example, you could have one head in the main living area and a second in the primary bedroom. Since you don’t need to worry about ducting, they can be installed in most rooms and are a great option for large and open concept spaces. These units are very quiet and efficient while operating. They have a lifespan of approximately 20 years with regular maintenance.\n\nHowever, due to their height on the wall, maintenance may be more difficult. The outdoor condenser also needs to be routinely cleaned to keep it free of debris. The install and maintenance of these units may need to be done by a professional if you’re not comfortable drilling through your home’s exterior yourself. The upfront cost can be quite expensive, but some utility companies are offering rebates, discounts, or financing plans to have these installed. As these are also considered a room air conditioner, they won’t provide you with whole-house cooling. They are also a very visible and permanent fixture, as they are attached to the wall up near the ceiling.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nDucted / Central Air / HVAC\n\nThis is the ultimate solution for whole-home cooling, but the most expensive of the options. If your house already has a ducted or forced air system in place, swapping an old oil or gas furnace can be a great choice. The system can also be controlled with a programmable or smart thermostat, which will help it to run the most efficiently. Of all the air conditioning options we discussed, this will be the quietest. Being able to keep your entire home at a comfortable temperature year-round is definitely the major advantage to this type of system.\n\nIf your home doesn’t already have ductwork in place, installing an HVAC or ducted heat pump probably isn’t the best option due to the cost and renovations needed.  HVAC maintenance may need to be done by a professional, but it can also be a DIY project . The lifespan for this version also isn’t the longest of the options, it’s estimated at about 15 years.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nGeneral Maintenance Tips\n\nA well-maintained air conditioner is going to run the most efficiently, which in turn helps to keep your costs down. It will also lead to a longer lifespan for the equipment, which will save you the cost of replacing it frequently! Since you are breathing in the air that the unit is blowing out, you definitely want to keep things clean. In humid climates, it’s easy for mold to grow if you’re not keeping up with maintenance. Some common areas you will want to inspect regularly include the filters, condenser and evaporator coils, the lines, ducts, and drains.\n\nIf you need any replacement parts for your AC unit, we have you covered!

Unfortunately, the condenser is prone dirt, dust, and pet hair build-up, and will need to be cleaned at least 1-2 times a year, ensuring your refrigerator keeps running as efficiently as possible.\n\nWhat Does a Condenser Do?\n\nThe purpose of the condenser is to get rid of the excess heat that is located in this sealed system. The fan draws air through that condenser to keep it cool. It is important to have a back panel on any fan-cooled condenser to direct the air flow through that coil.\n\nSymptoms of Clogged Condenser Coils\n\nThe dirt that accumulates on the refrigerators coils causes the condenser to preserve heat, rather then dispersing it, like it is meant to. This causes the compressor to have to work harder to overcompensate for what it senses as having too much heat. The compressor is the engine that runs the cooling process and is a very costly piece of equipment to replace. You might notice that it is running for longer periods of time, which is a good indication the coils are due for a cleaning. You might also notice a big jump in your utility bill.\n\nWhere are Condenser Coils Located?\n\nThe condenser coil can be found in a few different locations of a refrigerator depending on the model. Common locations include: the back of the unit, beneath the unit (these can be tricky to clean), and behind the front grille. To reduce the risk of electric shock, always unplug your appliance from the power before starting any maintenance or cleaning.\n\nHow to Clean Condenser Coils\n\nFan-Cooled Jelly-Roll\n\nThe jelly roll style condenser has tubing that is encased with a steel plate to help dissipate the heat. If upon inspection you have determined there is substantial build-up and it needs a cleaning, we suggest using a condenser cleaning brush. \n\nThese brushes are flexible and perfect for getting those tight spaces that are hard to reach. Insert the brush into the coils to loosen up any dirt and then vacuum up any remaining debris.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic Coils\n\nStatic condenser coils are much like fan-cooled jelly roll condenser coils, in terms of its function, and maintenance, but the cleaning will be slightly different. You’ll need to move your refrigerator away from the wall. You’ll then use your soft brush to remove any caked-on dust, and a vacuum to get rid of all the loose lint and dirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nFan-Cooled Open Coils\n\nTo clean a fan-cooled open coil condenser, you will first need to move the refrigerator away from the wall and remove the back panel. You will then use your flexible condenser brush to loosen any debris stuck in between each coil, and then use your vacuum to remove all the dirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegularly cleaning your refrigerator condenser coils considerably reduces the need to call a service repair technician and is a quick and easy job that can be done yourself! Not to mention, it will prevent unnecessary spikes in your energy bill. We hope this article and video gave you the confidence and tools to do this yourself!

Whatever you call this piece of equipment, it’s important to keep it well maintained throughout its useful life. In this article, we’ll discuss how to prepare your trimmer for the upcoming season, including the key areas you’ll need to inspect. We'll also share with you some maintenance tips so that your equipment continues to run efficiently. Feel free to follow along with the video as we go over each component of your trimmer and the steps involved to ensure it’s in top condition.  \n  \n \n \n\n\nDrain the Fuel Tank \n\nBefore beginning any inspection or maintenance on our trimmer, the very first thing we’re going to do is drain the fuel tank of any fuel that may be left in from last season. You want to pour this into a clean container so that you can inspect that fuel for any signs of dirt or debris. Then you’ll want to flush the fuel tank out a few times until it’s clean. Now that we have drained the fuel tank we can easily move the trimmer around without any spillage. Once that is done we can start our maintenance. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nInspect the Air Filters \n\nOur next step is going to be to inspect the air filter. To do this we’ll need to remove the cover to expose it. If the air filter is dirty and made of felt, you simply need to wash the felt filter in warm and soapy water. Once it’s dry the air filter can go back into the machine. If you have a foam filter, it will need to be oiled before going back into the trimmer. The easiest and least messy way to do this is to place the filter in a plastic bag, add clean motor oil, and massage the oil throughout the filter. Squeeze out any excess before replacing it in your trimmer. If your filter is damaged, it should be replaced with a new one.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nCheck the Carburetor\n\nThe next step is to carefully inspect the carburetor. To do so we’re going to remove the cover, which is held in place with a couple of nuts. One of the first things we’ll check is the primer or the purge bulb. Look for any signs of cracking or aging, if you see those you’ll need to replace this part. To do so, simply remove the two screws holding it in place, then replace the bulb. You then want to check the operation of the choke to make sure it stops in the indents. We'll also look at the throttle cable and make sure there are no signs of fraying or damage, and to check that it returns to the idle position easily and is not sticking. If you had noticed any dirt or debris when you emptied the fuel tank, it would be a good idea to give the carburetor a shot of cleaner through the opening by the chokes. We'll want to clean up this area of any excess dirt and debris and allow it to dry.  The next step will be to inspect the starter cord. Simply pull it out of the recoil starter and look for any signs of fraying or damage. If there is, you’ll need to remove the housing and replace the cord.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nMuffler and Spark Plug\n\nOnce we’re done with the carburetor, we’ll next look at the muffler or spark arrester. To inspect this we first need to remove the protective guard. Once we do that we can now look at the muffler, making careful note of any signs of corrosion or rust which may impair the performance of the muffler. Then we’ll remove the cover to check the spark arrestor as well. You want to make sure that there is no damage to the screen, and if so you’ll need to replace it. Once that’s done, replace the screen and put the cover and guard back on. The last part to check with the engine is the spark plug. Using a proper size plug wrench, we’ll remove the spark plug and check for any signs of corrosion or wear on the actual tip. If you see that kind of damage you should discard the plug. If you can, the plug can be carefully cleaned with a wire brush. We recommend that you put a fresh plug into your trimmer at the start of the season, and continue to check on it throughout the year. If replacing the plug, make sure the gap is set to the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nTrimmer Head\n\nNow that we’re done inspecting the engine components, we’re next going to look at the trimmer head. First, we will check the trimmer guard for any signs of cracks or damage. You’ll want to replace the guard if it is showing any of those signs. Then check the blade for the line cutter and make sure it’s in good shape. If not, you can simply replace that individually once we’ve inspected all of the trimmer. Next, we’ll look at the trimmer head itself. If it is damaged, you should replace the complete unit. Then we’ll verify that it is working properly. If it has a “tap and go” kind of system where you bump to release the line, make sure that is working.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nInstall New Line\n\nNow is a good time to install some new line in your trimmer head so it’s ready when the season starts. First remove the cover and the spool from the holder, again checking for any signs of damage. If there is, you may simply want to replace the whole head with a new one. Then we’ll remove any remaining line and discard it. Then, following the manufacturer's instructions, we’ll cut the pre-determined length of the appropriately sized line and install it on the spool. Make sure you do not put any more line on the spool than is recommended. Then reinstall the spool onto the holder, and ensure that you have roughly equal amounts of line hanging out on both ends. Now you’re ready to put that assembly back on the trimmer head by carefully lining up the tabs on the base with the openings on the head itself and once again check that the bottom button moves freely.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTighten 'er Up\n\nNow that we’ve got the trimmer head reassembled, we want to make sure that it is tight to the shaft. So we’re going to flip the unit back over and secure it. Most trimmers will have a mechanism for locking the gear so they don’t turn as you’re tightening the head. It typically involves either a pin or a small blade. A screwdriver will fit down through the opening to lock the assembly. Determine whether your trimmer is a left hand or right-hand thread, and turn the thread in the appropriate direction.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nLet 'er Rip!\n\nNow that we’ve completed our inspection and maintenance, we’re going to add a bit of fuel to make sure it runs properly. Once that’s complete, we’ll drain that fuel and wait for the season to start. Remember to check on the condition of items like the air filter, spark plugs, and head guard throughout the season for signs of damage. If you’ve noticed your trimmer requires some new parts, we have thousands of manufacturer-approved trimmer parts, which you can find by searching for your model number.

Not all lawn tractors are the same, but the tips we will share with you today will be applicable to all. Some of the key things we\n will cover are the air and fuel systems, ignition system, engine oil and filter, linkages and cables, the mower deck, the blades, the drive\n system, and lastly, the tire pressure. Feel free to follow along to our video found below for complete visuals and tips and tricks from our repair technician, Steve.\n \n \n\n\n\n\nStep 1: How to Remove the Mower Deck\n\nBefore you begin any maintenance, remove the ignition key so you do not inadvertently start the mower while you are working on it. You will start by\n removing the mower deck, allowing you access to change the oil, inspect the filter, ignition system, and the cable and linkage. Most ride-on mowers\n will suspend the mower deck from the tractor frame with either a three-point system or a four-point system. Before you release the deck mechanism\n from the lawn tractor frame, lower it completely down to the floor level. Before removing the whole deck, you will need to release the belt from\n the pulley, and the guard will need to be removed first, which will allow you to roll the belt off the pulley. Now that the deck is released\n from the rear and front mounts, the front belt guard is loose, and it is pulled away, you should now be able to lift the mechanism at the back by\n raising the lever and then sliding the deck completely out. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 2: Check the Engine Oil and Filter\n \n Pull the dipstick out and have a look at the condition of the oil. If the level is low or the oil looks contaminated in any way, it will need to\n be changed. Before you begin to drain the crankcase oil, make sure that you place something underneath to protect against spills and that it is large\n enough in size to capture all the oil. Some models may come with an extension which will assist in the draining process.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Once it has completely drained, we will look to replace the oil filter. Place a rag underneath to catch any remaining oil. Now use an oil filter\n removing tool to remove it (this may take some effort). Once the bond has been broken, it should remove easily. Be very careful when removing the oil\n filter as it will be full of oil. Drain the excess oil out of the filter and dispose of it responsibly. \n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Before you install the new filter, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Ours suggests filling the filter to the bottom of the threads\n first and allow a couple of minutes for that to soak in. Once you have achieved the proper level of oil in your filter, you will want to put a little\n bit of film oil around the gasket and clean the base where the filter is going to mount. Mount the new oil filter into place, remove the drain tube\n and close off the cap.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Now add the rest of the oil to the crankcase, following the manufacturer's instructions for the amount you should use, and be sure to use the\n proper oil for your particular model. Once the oil has drained down into the tube, check your dipstick to ensure its at the appropriate level.\n \n Step 3: Inspect the Air Filter System\n \n To access the air filter, you will need to start by removing the air filter housing. Look for signs of excessive build-up of debris or damage to\n the filter itself. You will want to refer to your owner’s manual for specific guidelines relating to air filter replacement. For the lawn tractor we\n are using, it needs to be replaced every 100 operating hours. We simply pull off the old filter, discard, and line up the \n new air filter onto the\n housing.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 4: Inspect the Fuel System\n \n Check the condition of the fuel filter itself and the fuel inside it. If the fuel is contaminated or the fuel filter is showing signs\n of wear, you will need to replace it. For this simple repair, you would just remove the two clamps and slide them up the hose and place the\n fuel filter in its place. Make sure you have something to collect the fuel that spills. If you notice that the filter looks dirty, you will want\n to also do a clean of the carburetor. If the carburetor is beyond the state of cleaning or appears worn,\n replace the carburetor.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n If you are using a carburetor cleaner, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. For the style of lawn tractor we are working on, the\n manufacturer specifies that the engine should be running while spraying into the throat of the carburetor itself and around any exterior surface\n where any dirt might be built up.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 5: Inspect the Cables and Linkage\n \n When inspecting the cables look for any signs of damage towards the ends, or if they are really stiff to move they will also need to be replaced.\n Also, take note that the adjustments are tightened securely.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 6: Check the Spark Plug\n \n For the model we are working on, we will need to remove the top cover, which is held in place with four screws. Depending on your model, this\n step may not be necessary. Now pull the plug wire off, and take your proper sized plug wrench, and remove the spark plug. Inspect the electrode end\n of the spark plug for any signs of wear or damage. Always refer to your manufacturer's recommendations on how often to replace this part or replace it\n if it appears damaged. Next, you will need to inspect the plug wire and make sure it does not have any cracks or damage to the cap, and that it fits\n on nice and snug to the end of the plug. If you removed the top cover, this is a good time to give it a quick check and remove any debris if\n necessary and place it back on the engine.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 7: Inspect the Mower Deck and Blades\n \n Start by looking at the belt and checking for any signs of damage, such as cracks or rips. If you have determined that the belt needs to be\n replaced, you will need to remove the two idler pulleys because the guards are in the way of the belts coming off. On the spindle pulleys, you will\n need to loosen those or remove the two outside bolts and loosen them enough that you can wrap the belt around them.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Remove the bolt from the guard and you should be able to peel the belt off, you may need to remove the shields to give yourself enough clearance.\n Now you will do the same process for the opposite side. When installing the new belt follow the layout that is printed on the top of the deck \n (this may vary by model). Start by feeding the belt around the spindle pulleys. Verify that the belts are lined up properly.\n \n Now it is time to inspect the bottom of the mower deck. Inspect the blades to determine whether you need to either sharpen them or replace them.\n If they have large chips out of them or are worn down from excessive sharpening, they will need to be replaced. If they are just slightly dull, you\n can take them off and grind a new sharp edge.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Before sliding the deck back under the ride-on, make sure the rear pins are in the lock open position so the lifts will slide right down through\n the two slots easily. Also, remove the jam nut and nut from the front hook, taking note of the measurement of where the nut ends up. Remove the nuts\n completely and now you will be able to easily reinstall the deck.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Slide the deck back underneath the tractor, making sure the pin is put back in the proper hole, fitting on the backside of the bracket. Pull\n the mower deck towards the front of the ride-on and feed the belt around the drive pulley. Tuck it behind the guard, while making sure not to lose\n the connection between the guard on the left-hand side with the clutch. It should fit into a slot on there, and it’s important that it is secure.\n When installing the hook, make sure it goes on in the same manner that you removed it. Slide it through the slotted opening on the front first and \n then fit the J end of the hook into the front of the deck. Now put the deck back into the raised position.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Step 8: Check the Tires\n \n Your final step is to do a check of the air pressure in the tires and their overall condition. If they look inflated, give them some air, and if\n they are damaged, they will need to be replaced. \n \n We hope this lawn tractor maintenance guide has helped walk you through this important checklist.

As we aim to answer the most common symptom questions and solutions, we \nwill also cover how the icemaker works and the main components to be aware of as you try and troubleshoot your own appliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the style of refrigerator you have, whether it be French door style, bottom mount, side-by-side, top-mount, if it is a heat release\n icemaker, it probably resembles one of three units (seen in the image below). All three units will have similar components of an icemaker, which we\n will explain as we go through each symptom.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Components of an Icemaker:\n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe mold (where the ice cubes form)\n\t\t\tHeater (embedded in the mold)\n\t\t\tEject arm\n\t\t\tBail/shut-off arm\n\t\t\tControl (located on the front)\n\t\t\tHarness connector (these can come in different styles)\n\t\t\tShut-off lever (can vary depending on the brand)\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tHow Does a Heat Release Icemaker Work?\n\t\n\tThe heat-release icemaker works by partially filling with water, and as the icemaker is sitting in the freezer, eventually that water will \n\tfreeze and turn to ice. When that happens, a thermostat that is located on the front end of that mold will detect the temperature. Once it detects\n\ta certain temperature, it will close the circuit. In the control section, this turns on a motor, and this will rotate the ejector arm, which will\n\trotate down on top of the ice cubes. The ejector arm will then just sit there and put pressure on the ice cubes. At the same time the motor\n\tis operating, on the bottom side of the icemaker, embedded into the mold itself, is an electric heater. The heater is turned on at the same time\n\tand will slowly warm up that mold. Once it reaches a certain temperature, this breaks the bond between the ice cube and the interior surface of\n\tthe mold. When that happens, the ejector arm can now push those ice cubes, rotate them back up the opposite side, lift out, slide over the edge,\n\tand drop them down into the ice container. At the same time that this is happening, as the ice cubes are fully ejected, the water valve that is\n\tlocated at the back of the refrigerator (single or two coil, or in the case of some models that use dispensers and filters, they may have as many\n\tas 3-4 solenoid coils), will turn on the coil that affects the icemaker, water will enter the cup at the rear of the ice maker or through the back\n\t, and it will run for a specific amount of time until it fills that mold to the proper level. The mold will sit there and wait for the process to\n\tstart all over again.\n\t\n\tWhy Isn’t my Icemaker Working?\n\t\n\tNow that you have a basic idea of how an icemaker works, lets dive into some of the symptoms that may occur and troubleshoot what could go \n\twrong with your icemaker.\n\t\n\tSymptom 1: No Ice Cubes are Being Produced\n\t\n\tBail arm\n\t\n\tMake sure the bail arm is not locked in the off position (this applies to a drop-down bail type or a slide-open type shut off lever). It should\n\tbe in the down position, which will turn on the icemaker control, allowing it to harvest ice cubes as they become frozen.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tIcemaker control\n\t\n\tIf the bail arm is working properly, the problem may be with the internal switch located on the control arm. It is operated by the bail arm,\n\twhich fits into a slotted opening on the control, and this controls the set of contacts located underneath. When the bail arm is in the \"on\" position, one set of contacts is closed, and when it is in the off position, a separate set of contacts are closed. If the contacts fail to make it into\n\tthe \"on\" position, the icemaker will not harvest any cubes. The components of the control are not serviceable, so if the issue is here, the entire\n\tcontrol will need to be replaced.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tSymptom 2: Ice Cubes are too Small\n\t\n\tWater line restriction\n\t\n\tIf the ice cubes are too small that would be an indication that not enough water is getting into the mold. There is no float that governs\n\tthe level of water in that mold, it is completely controlled by the amount of time that the water valve is turned on, which is controlled by\n\tthe icemaker control at the front. It is adjustable to a certain extent and typically somewhere between seven to ten seconds of fill time\n\tthrough the water valve, will give an adequate amount of time to fill the mold. Before making any adjustments, if it has been working fine\n\tall along, chances are it is not the control that is giving you the problem, it is likely a restriction in the water line going to the icemaker.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tSymptom 3: Ice Cubes are too Large\n\t\n\tFill valve\n\t\n\tThe most common reason for ice cubes being too large is the fill valve is staying on longer than power is being applied to it. This is a\n\tmechanical problem with the fill valve, making it so it does not shut off right away, allowing too much water in. This is usually caused by\n\tdirt getting inside of the valve, and the only way to correct this, is to replace it.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tSymptom 4: Ice Bin Overflows\n\t\n\tBail Arm\n\t\n\tThe bail arm may be the incorrect one for your model. If you have recently replaced the bail arm, and are having this issue, double check\n\tthat you have the correct part for your specific model. The function of the bail arm, is that it should lift up during the ejection of the\n\tcubes and as it drops back down, if its not able to go all the way, or if it sits on top of the bin, this should shut the icemaker off without\n\tbeing in the locked position. If this does not happen because the bail arm is not the correct one, and doesn’t drop down far enough, you will\n\tget a bin that fills up with too much ice.\n\t\n\tIcemaker Head\n\t\n\tIf there is a defect with the icemaker head, it will make it so the icemaker does not shut off.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tSymptom 5: No Cubes in the Mold\n\t\n\tThis symptom might also cause water to splash over the actual ice bin and freeze the cubes together.\n\t\n\tFill Tube/Fill Valve\n\t\n\tThe fill tube brings water into the fill cup and if this freezes up, water will splash everywhere, and none will get down into the mold\n\titself. This is usually caused by the fill valve.\n\t\n\tWe hope that after reviewing our common symptoms and solutions you have been able to troubleshoot your own icemaker and have narrowed\n\tdown the parts you will need for your repair. If you have determined you need to replace one of the parts above, you can use your model number\n\tto search PartSelect.com for the OEM replacement part needed to get your icemaker back up and running again.

Over time, the water filter will need to be changed to make sure you are getting the freshest water possible. You may notice that your water filter needs to be changed if the change filter light comes on. Your fridge filter doesn’t just filter the water that you use in your dispenser, but also the water that’s used to make ice. So if you’re a fan of ice in your drinks, you may need a filter change sooner than you’re expecting. Today’s refrigerators monitor how much water is used for making ice and dispensing water. Once a pre-determined amount has been reached, your fridge will turn on a status indicator light for your filter to let you know it’s time for a change.\n\nChanging the filter in your fridge on a regular basis isn’t only necessary, it’s easy to do! It’s also easy and necessary to reset the water status indicator light so your fridge can remind you when it’s time to change the filter again. If your fridge doesn’t have a status indicator light, a good rule of thumb is to change your filter every six to nine months. There are signs you should change your water filter, other than what the water filter indicator shows. If you experience a decreased water flow through your dispenser, or you notice a taste or discoloration in your water, it’s time to change your filter. \n\nWe’ve chosen three refrigerator models to help you figure out how to change the water filter in your fridge. \n\n \n \n\n\nModel One\n\nFirst up is a typical Whirlpool side-by-side model.  \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n\nOn these models, the water filter is located through the front of the kick plate at the bottom of the refrigerator. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nStart by grasping the knob at the end of the filter assembly and then turn it counter clockwise about a quarter of a turn, and pull the filter out through the opening.\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nNext, take your new filter and slide the refrigerator knob onto the end of it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n\nRemove the protective cap.\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nPut the filter into the fridge with the handle or knob in the vertical position. Press it in firmly and then rotate it clockwise until it locks into place. \n\nNow that you have your new filter installed, you should run some water through the dispenser to purge any air that may be in your system. Once you have purged enough water through the system that you no longer have any air coming through, re-set the status indicator light. On the model shown, you would simply need to hold the filter reset button until the light turns green again. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n  \n \nModel Two\n\nThe next model we have chosen to demonstrate is the Frigidaire Gallery style side-by-side.\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nTo access the water filter, open the fresh food door and press on the release button located toward the top of the fridge. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nThe filter will pop forward and you can pull it out of the housing.\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nNext, take the new filter, remove the protective caps, and insert the filter into the housing.\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nWhen inserting your new water filter, make sure to press firmly onto it until it latches into place. As with the previous model, make sure to purge all of the air out of the system. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to reset the filter status light. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n  \nTo reset the filter status light, simply press and hold the button until you see the light flash green. The green light lets you know that the filter has been reset.\n\nModel Three\n\nThe final model we have chosen to demonstrate is a Whirlpool French door style. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nThe filter is located toward the top of the fridge above a covering. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nTo access the filter, release the tab, drop the cover down and grasp the filter. Tilt the filter down enough that you can get a grip on it and turn it counter clockwise until it releases and then you can discard the old filter. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nBefore installing the new filter, remove the protective film on the top and then you’re ready to put it into the holder. \n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n \nPress the filter firmly back into place and then rotate it a quarter of a turn clockwise until it locks on. Fit the filter up into the holder and close the cover.\n\nOn this model, you need to press the reset filter button and hold it in for approximately three seconds until the lights disappear and then you’re all set!\n\nSaveEmbed Image  \n\nFinding the Right Filter\n\nWith so many different options available, you want to be sure you are selecting the proper filter for your refrigerator. The best rule-of-thumb is to use filters that are created by the manufacturer, as these were designed specifically for your machine. Using the correct filter ensures a proper fit, giving you fresh and clean water and ice with each use. But how do you know which filter is the right product for your fridge? We’ve made it easy with our Water Filter Finder - just select the brand of fridge you have, what type or style it is, where the filter is located, how the filter comes out of your refrigerator. With that information, we can easily find the right filter for you!\n\nSet a Reminder\n\nYou know that you need to change your water filter around every six months, and you know where to find the right filter for your fridge. But now you have to actually remember to order a new one AND change it out?! Once again, we’ve solved that problem for you! We have created a water filter subscription service that will automatically send you a new filter, at your predetermined intervals. You no longer need to put sticky notes on the fridge or reminders in your phone – we'll take care of remembering for you.

From purees, to smoothies, to sauces, a good blender can be the work horse of the kitchen. Blenders also get grungy over time and with all of those little nooks and crannies to clean, it can be a challenge to keep your appliance sparkling. With our tips and tricks, we’ll show you how to properly clean and maintain your blender so that it looks just like brand new!\n\n \n \n\n\nRegular cleaning\n\nFor regular cleaning, you simply need to remove the jug from the base. In most cases, you can wash the jug in soapy water in your sink by hand. If possible, you’ll want to separate the base and the blade assembly from the jug first because the blades are typically quite sharp, and you’ll want to use extra caution when cleaning around them. If your blender uses a glass jug, you can put that in your dishwasher after you’ve removed the top and base assembly. \n\nDeep cleaning\n\nIf your blender is very dirty or stained, clean it with a blend of hot water, baking soda and a quarter of a cup of white vinegar. Add the mixture to the blender and then add a few drops of dish soap. Put the jug onto the blender base and run your blender for a minute or two. Dump the mixture out, and then rinse your jug thoroughly and wash it by hand. \n\nFor blenders that use a plastic jug, you may get a taste or smell from the plastic over time. An easy way to remove that is to cut up some lemon slices, put them into your blender with some warm water, and then blend for a couple of minutes. You may need to do this periodically to maintain a nice, fresh smell in your blender.\n\nSometimes stains are just too stubborn to be cleaned away by any of the above methods. If you find that your jug is still stained despite your best efforts, you can soak your blender overnight using a mixture of baking soda, vinegar, and dish soap. Simply put one cup of white vinegar, a few drops of dish soap and half a cup of baking soda into your blender. The mixture will bubble up, when the bubbling subsides, turn your blender on for a few seconds to mix everything together thoroughly and then let it sit in the jug for a few hours. Dump everything out after a few hours have passed and then rinse the jug with warm water. If the blender smells like the baking soda and vinegar mixture, you can put water and a few drops of dish detergent into the jug and put your blender on for a few seconds.\n\nBlades\n\nSometimes your blades will still look dirty despite blending the mixtures mentioned above. One trick is to use denture cleaning tablets such as Polydent. If possible, separate the jug from the blades and then submerge the blades in water with one or two tablets. The tabs should remove any stubborn stains. \n\nIf you are unable to separate the jug from the blades, you can always clean them in the jug. Simply pour in enough hot water to make sure the blades are covered and then drop in one or two denture cleaning tablets. Let the mixture soak for about a half hour and then rinse thoroughly with warm water. \n\nCaked on food\n\nIf your blender has caked on food debris, a little bit of elbow grease may be needed. You can scrub it off by using a rough sponge, toothbrush, or – in the cases of extreme stubborn stains – steel wool. The type of tool you’ll need to clean your blender will depend on how caked on the food is. Put a little bit of water and dish soap into your blender and then chip away at the stains with whatever your chosen tool is until the caked-on debris disappears. \n\nDrying\n\nOnce your jug is clean, it’s best to put it upside-down on your dish drying rack and to let it air dry. If you are in a hurry to put your blender away, make sure to thoroughly dry the inside with a dish towel before you put the lid back on to avoid bacterial growth.\n\nCleaning the base\n\nThe jug isn’t the only part of your blender that can get dingy, the base also needs attention from time to time. Don’t immerse your blender base in water! The base contains the motor and control system and soaking it in water may cause the machine to stop working. Make sure to keep any cleaning measures to the exterior only! \n\nTo clean your blender base, take a sponge or dish cloth, soak it in warm soapy water and then wring it until it’s damp. Gently clean off any spills or caked on food. \n\nWhenever possible, make sure to wipe up spills when they happen. The longer food debris stays on your base, the more it will harden which will make it more difficult to remove later. Caked on food may even stain your base!\n\nUse a Q-tip to get between crevices or buttons that are harder to reach. Simply dampen your Q-tip with soapy water and then clean in and around those hard-to-reach spots. \nWhen you’re finished cleaning your base, use a dry dish towel to thoroughly dry any places that may still be moist.\n\nOnce your blender is clean and dry, you’re ready to reassemble it and put it away until you are ready to use it again!\n\nDid you find parts that need to be replaced as you were cleaning your blender? We have a wide variety of blender parts. Make sure to have your model number handy so you can find what you need!\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Raised planter boxes are the perfect option if you’re looking to keep things organized, add some visual interest to your yard, or if your soil quality isn’t great for growing. Follow along to see how we’ve built this economical option, and how to prepare it for gardening season.\n\nBuild the Garden Bed \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nThings You’ll Need\n2” x 10” boards (3)\n2” x 4” boards (3)\nDrill\nDeck screws (approximately 50)\nMeasuring tape \nLevel\nStraight edge\nPencil\nSaw\n\n\n\n\nWe used regular SPF lumber for this project. Untreated wood will eventually rot, however there are concerns that treated lumber will leach chemicals into your soil. Do your research on what type of wood is best for your garden needs. Something like cedar will last much longer, but comes at a higher cost.\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nStep 1: Choose the Location\nFirst, decide what you want to plant in these garden boxes, then determine where has enough sunlight. Most veggie gardens will require full sunlight (at least six hours per day, preferably more) but leafy greens like cabbages can tolerate some shade. If your boxes are just for flowers or shrubs, many will grow just fine in partially or fully shaded areas. But typically you’re going to want southern exposure, without any trees or fences blocking the light. Additionally, you’ll want to make sure your hose is long enough to reach the garden bed location for frequent watering.\n\nStep 2: Measure For Size\nDetermine what size works for your space and budget. In this guide, we’re building a 3-foot-by-6-foot bed for less than $75 (based on 2020’s lumber prices – we realize this may not be feasible in 2021!). The larger the box, the more you’ll pay for materials to both build and to fill it with soil.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nStep 3: Cut 2x10s To Size \nIf you don’t own a saw, or aren’t comfortable using one, you can have the hardware store cut the wood for you if you bring your measurements along. Otherwise, use your tape measure, straightedge, and pencil to mark your desired length on your 2x10 board. Make sure you’re wearing proper PPE (personal protective equipment) when operating any power tools – ear and eye protection are important! \nYou’re going to repeat this process so you have two boards of equal size for the length (6 feet), and two boards of equal size to be the width (3 feet).\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStep 4: Fasten Corners\nFor this step you will need a drill and deck screws. The reason we’re using deck screws is that they’re made for the outside and will not rust. If you use interior screws they will eventually rust, and you don’t want that getting into your soil. We’re going to use four screws per corner to fasten the boards together. At this point, if you just want a basic garden box, you’re all done!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStep 5: Cut 2x4s To Size\nIf you want to add a ledge for seating and some support, we’re now going to measure and cut our 2x4s to size. We’re going to be starting with the short ends of the garden box, measuring from outside edge to outside edge. Like before, mark your measurements with the pencil and straightedge, and cut your lengths with the saw.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStep 6: Attach Ledges\nAt this point, we’ve only measured and cut the 2x4s for the short ends of our box. We're going to attach these using 4 deck screws. Once both ends are attached, we’ll then measure the inside edges for the length of the box. Once again measure, mark, and make your cuts.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStep 7: Attach Ledge Supports\nKeep any extra pieces cut from the 2x4s. Before we attach the long ledges, we’re going to use the extra wood to provide additional structural support for the ledge. Fasten them to the interior of the planter box, then place the long cuts of 2x4 on top and screw them into place.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nStep 8: Make Sure It’s Level\nOnce you’ve checked that your work is level, you’re ready to start planting!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPlant the Bed \n\nNow that you’ve got your raised garden bed built, it’s time to plant it! Depending on the time of year, and where you’re located, you may be able to go right to planting, otherwise, you can get things prepped and wait until the threat of frost has passed.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nThings You’ll Need\nThe garden bed you just built\nWeed barrier (cardboard or landscape fabric)*\nSoil\nRake\nSource of nitrogen\nYour transplants or seeds\nHose\n\n\n* If your garden bed is less than 6 inches deep, you’ll want to put down a weed barrier before adding the soil. Cardboard or landscaping fabric are both great options. If you used lumber sizes as we recommended, your bed should be 10 inches high, and we can skip this step.\n\n\nStep 9: Fill Bed With Soil\nFirst we’ll need to determine how much soil is needed for the raised bed. If your planter is rectangular, this should be a simple volume equation of length x width x height. However, there are many calculators available online specifically for measuring soil quantity. Determine the number of bags you’ll need, or if you have multiple beds, you may be better off having soil delivered by the cubic yard. Use a rake to level out the soil as you’re dumping it in.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStep 10: Add Nitrogen Source\nPlants need nitrogen in order to grow, and without enough their growth can be stunted. There are a few different ways you can add this to your garden beds. The first is purchasing enriched soil, typically classified as NPK for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This is the pricier option, so if you’re on a budget you can use campfire ashes as a source of phosphorus and potassium, while used coffee grounds will provide nitrogen. So if you enjoy your French press in the morning and a backyard campfire in the evening, keep a hold of those coffee grounds and ashes! The third option is to include nitrogen-fixing plants like peas in the garden bed. Peas produce their own nitrogen and will add it to the soil, which your other plants will benefit from.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStep 11: Time to Plant!\nDepending on your region, once the risk of frost has passed, you are “good to grow!” \nBe mindful of the spacing requirements necessary for your seeds or transplants, as you don’t want to overcrowd your plants. Dig a small hole to place your plant or seed into, and cover with soil. Once you’ve got everything planted, be sure to give it a good drink of water. Daily watering in the morning or evening will help the roots to set or to germinate the seeds. With proper care and some patience, you’ll soon be able to enjoy your delicious homegrown fruits and veggies, or beautiful flowers!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

While you can purchase products commercially to do that job, we will show you how to use some common ingredients that you have around your home to get your coffee maker sparkling clean and looking like new!\n\nBefore you do a deep clean cycle, you should remove all of the items that are easily removable such as the reusable filter, the filter holder, the valve assembly and the coffee pot itself. All of these items can be washed using liquid dish detergent and hot water. After you’re finished washing these, make sure you rinse them thoroughly and allow them to dry.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n \nTo clean our coffee maker, we used the denture tab cleaning method. To use this method, begin by filling up your coffee pot with water and pouring that into your coffee maker. \n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nNext, put the coffee pot into its spot on the machine and add your denture cleaning tablet. \n\nSaveEmbed Image \n \nOnce tablet has been added to the water, you will see the water start to foam. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nNext, close the lid of your coffee maker and start a normal cycle.\nOnce you’ve allowed your coffee maker to go through a complete cycle, inspect the contents of the pot. If you see that the water is discolored, don't worry, that just means your deep cleaning is doing its job! Water discoloration is typical of the mineral content that would have been inside the tubing of your coffee maker. \n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nDiscard this pot of water and then put at least one or two full pots of water through your coffee maker without using any coffee and then do a taste test. If you find you have a residue of a denture-cleaning tab taste, you’ll need to rinse your machine one more time. We suggest that you use lemon juice – either freshly squeezed or store-bought. Put a tablespoon or two of lemon juice into your coffee maker along with water, run it through a cycle, and then rinse it a couple of times after that and all of the residue should be removed.\n\nNo Tabs? No Worries!\nCoffee makers can also be cleaned using white vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid. To clean using these agents, simply fill your coffee pot with 1/3 of the vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid and 2/3 water. Pour the solution into your coffee maker’s water reservoir and then start the brewing cycle. When the cycle is complete, discard the pot of water.  \n\nCleaning the Exterior\nNext, it’s time to clean the exterior of your coffee maker with a soft cloth. You can fill a spray bottle with 1/3 white vinegar and 2/3 water. Make sure your coffee maker is turned off and unplugged, then spray your solution onto the exterior of the coffee maker and wipe it down with a cloth. Don’t be afraid to dampen any areas that have stubborn grime and use a little bit of elbow grease! Once the exterior of your machine is clean, wipe it dry with a soft, dry cloth to remove any remaining moisture. \n\nIf you discover a broken part while cleaning your coffee maker, don’t worry, we have a number of  coffee maker parts that you can order! Make sure you have your model number so you can quickly find the part your machine needs so you can fix it and have it running like new again!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

However, there are areas inside the appliance where detergent can build up along with dirt and grime which will eventually start to smell. Getting to those areas may appear a bit tricky, but we’ll show you that it is much easier than you think! However, if you happen to have a weak stomach, this repair may be rated as \"difficult.\" Globs of old detergent and matted hair can defeat the best of us, so have a helper on standby if needed. Feel free to follow along with the video below as we go through how to clean your top load washer step-by-step.\n\n \n \n\n \nThings You’ll Need\n\nLarge sink or container with very hot water\nYour preferred commercial cleaning product\nbaking soda and vinegar solution\nSoft brush and rag\nOld toothbrush\nA strong stomach\n   \n\n\nThe Fabric Softener Dispenser\n\nOne area that detergent and fabric softener will build up in and begin to smell is the center agitator. Depending on your washer model, the agitator may be bolted to a transmission shaft and some may just be a friction fit. Some (particularly GE models) have an agitator drive block right at the bottom of the tub. The first part we’ll remove to clean is the fabric softener dispenser. Most other brands will have a removable fabric softener dispenser that can be popped off with a bit of pressure. To remove that you would simply grasp the outside edges and pull up sharply.\n\nFabric softener and detergent typically don’t mix very well, and can form a glue-like substance. To clean the dispenser, we suggest soaking in very hot water, and using baking soda or vinegar, or a combination of both. Allow it to soak and then scrub off the debris with a soft brush or rag. Be sure to rinse the dispenser thoroughly afterward.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe Agitator and Base\n\nWith the fabric softener dispenser removed we can see down the barrel of the agitator. If you can see the head of a bolt, it would indicate the agitator is attached to the transmission shaft. You can remove that bolt and pull up on the base of the agitator to remove it. Any build-up can be cleaned off with your preferred commercial cleaner and a soft brush. With the agitator removed we’ll also be able to clean any build-up on the bottom of the machine, which could be made up of detergent, minerals in the water, or fabric softener. Gently scrub any of the debris caught in the groves, as this is a hidden source of odor you can’t see when the agitator base is in place.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe Tub Cover and Outer Tub\n\nNext we’ll raise the main top and lid assembly to expose the tub cover. Depending on your model the main top may be held in place with spring clips or there may be screws that attach it to the front panel or cabinet. Once lifted, we can inspect the tub cover. Around the perimeter, there are drain holes, which can end up clogged with debris. This can be scrubbed out and sprayed down with a commercial cleaner and hot water. To clean the underside of the cover, we’ll need to remove it from the tub. It is typically attached to the outer tub with plastic clips, and when detaching this style of plastic you may want to push down to depress the gasket, then release the individual clips holding the cover in place. Once again, wash this part with hot water, cleaner, and a soft brush. Be sure not to distort the gasket so that the tub cover is able to seal against the outer tub when reattached. With the cover still removed, you can clean the top portion of the inner tub basket.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFinal Steps and General Maintenance\n\nTo finish up, we’ll look at the water inlet injector and see if there’s any buildup, which again can be a cause of odor. This area can be cleaned with a spray cleaner or a vinegar and baking soda solution.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nYou did it! Now that you've finished deep cleaning your machine, here are some tips so it never gets that filthy again. We suggest at the end of each cycle that you leave the lid open to allow the inner basket and outer tub to dry thoroughly between loads. As well, be sure to wipe up any spills of fabric softener, detergent, or liquid bleach as they occur. Wipe down the lid periodically and get into those nooks and crannies with a toothbrush. In between these deep cleans, you may want to run your washer on a hot water cycle with vinegar or bleach (no clothes included, just an empty drum!). This can help break down some of the build-up of detergent and minerals in your machine.\n\nIf you managed to clean all the hair out of your washer's tricky spots, you're officially ready to tackle the next project: snaking the shower drain.\n\nIf you’ve noticed while cleaning that your appliance needs some repair, we have thousands of manufacturer-approved washer parts, which you can find by searching for your model number.

Whether you have a single-handle-style faucet or a two-handle-style faucet, we will cover the most common leaks that occur and how to fix them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Handle Faucet\n\nWith the single-handle faucet, whether the leak is a drip coming out of the spout or a leak around the base of the stem, it is typically a single component that causes both issues.\n \nSteps for repairing a leak around the base or spout:\n\n\nYou will start by turning off the hot and cold water supply to the faucet.\nThe cartridge for the single handle faucet is located just below the handle. Start by removing the handle. You will need to identify the type of set screw holes that are on the handle. Typically, a small Allen key or hex will do the job and are often supplied with the replacement cartridge.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nLift the handle off.\nRemove the protective cover that sits over top of the cartridge. Some models may have a retaining nut on the top, but most of them are a friction fit or have an O-ring that holds it in place.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nNow you will remove the cartridge, using the proper-size socket or an adjustable wrench. As you remove this there will be a fair bit of water that will come out, even with the supplies turned off. Have a clean cloth nearby to catch that excess water.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWith the retaining cap removed, grasp the top of that cartridge, and pull it up and out of that opening. Most of these single-handled faucets use a similar style of cartridge. It has a built-in gasket for both the hot and cold and a larger one for the actual spout. Look carefully to see if you notice any damage to the gasket or any built-up debris.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n \nReplacing the Cartridge\n\n\nPlace the cartridge into the seat. Most cartridges have indents that will only allow you to place it into the seat one way. \nSecure the retaining cap onto the cartridge by turning it clockwise and then tightening it with the appropriate socket or adjustable wrench.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRe-install the decorative cap.\nNow place the handle back on. The kit we are using for an example came with a set screw, and that will get installed into the handle. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nCheck to make sure the handle is secure.\nTurn the water back on and check for leaks.\n\n\nTwo-Handle Faucet\n\nFor this example, we have a two-handle faucet with the quarter-turn type valves, with a single spout in the middle. This leak is located around the base of the faucet.\n\nSteps for repairing a leak around the base:\n\n\nTurn off the water supply.\nRemove the retaining nut around the spout. Use a belt off an appliance to place around the spout, this will help get a good grip on the retainer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOnce it is loosened, you should be able to turn it off by hand. Pull the spout up and out of the opening. Some water will may come out of the spout.\nInspect the O-ring for damage.\n\n\nReplacing the O-Ring\n\n\nSlide the new O-ring into place.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nClean the base of the faucet where the O-ring will be seated in place.\nThread the retaining nut back onto the faucet by hand and then use the rubber belt and pliers to tighten it.\n\n\nSteps for repairing a leak around the handle:\n\nRemove the handle to gain access to the cartridge. Loosen the set screw and remove the handle.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRemove the retaining nut.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPull out the cartridge.\nInspect the O-ring. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nLine up the cartridge so it easily sits into place, making sure the indents are lined up properly, and the stop cam is facing towards the center of the faucet.\nRe-install the retaining nut by threading it by hand, ensuring it is not cross threaded. Use your wrench to tighten.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhen re-installing the handle, make sure the flat side of the stem is pointed away from the center of the faucet. \nLine up the set screw with the flat side, tighten and secure.\nMake sure there is no slack in the handle.\nTurn the water supply back on.\nTurn on the faucet to check for leaks.\n\nAs you can see, repairing a leaking faucet yourself is a pretty easy fix, and can save you the cost of a repair person. Not to mention saving the cost of all that water and money dripping down your drains! We hope this information will help you with your own DIY repair, good luck!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

A bad smell in a refrigerator is almost always caused by food that is past its prime, or spills\n that were never dealt with. The very first step should be to remove all the spoiled food items from your refrigerator. Now before we get into how to\n clean your refrigerator, we are going to go over how a refrigerator works, as this will help in getting rid of those gross smells.\n\n\n\n\n \n How Your Refrigerator Works \n \n Whether you have a side-by-side model, bottom freezer or top freezer, all refrigerator styles circulate air from the freezer through the fresh\n food compartment and back into the freezer continuously as long as the refrigerator is running. This means that any odors that occur in the\n refrigerator typically get distributed in both the freezer and the fresh food compartments. The plastic lining of your refrigerator can absorb\n those smells if they are severe enough.\n \n Steps for Cleaning Your Smelly Refrigerator\n \n Gather The Materials Needed to Clean the Smell:\n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t\tMild soap\n\t\t\tSoft sponge\n\t\t\tWhite vinegar\n\t\t\tLemon juice (optional)\n\t\t\tOdor absorbent (baking soda, coffee grounds, activated charcoal)\n\t\t\tSmall plate\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tGive the Interior of Your Refrigerator a Thorough Cleaning\n\t\n\tOnce you’ve removed the spoiled items from your refrigerator, the next step is to do a thorough cleaning. To begin the\n\tcleaning process, start by removing all of the shelves, and clean those individually with warm soapy water, rinse, and\n\tthen let them completely dry. Next, you will want to clean the interior of the fridge. The plastic liner of the refrigerator and the doors can\n\tabsorb some of those smells so they will also need a good deep scrub. You can use a warm soapy water and a soft sponge or rag. Be sure to get into\n\tall the little cracks and crevices. All shelves, bins, door gaskets, and handles in your refrigerator are parts that can easily be replaced if they are beyond\n\tthe state of cleaning, and can give your appliance a \"like new\" look.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tRinse Your Refrigerator\n\t\n\tNow that the interior part of the fridge is clean it will need to get a good rinse. You can just use water, but we recommend using water with\n\ta bit of cleaning vinegar or white vinegar mixed with it, about a ten to one water to vinegar ratio. You can also add a few drops of lemon juice\n\tto give it a nice refreshing smell. Once everything has been washed and rinsed completely, allow it dry before reassembling the shelves back in.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tAdd an Odor Absorbent\n\t\n\tTo get rid of any of that lingering odor, one of the best and most simple solutions is to use baking soda. Simply sprinkle some on a small\n\tplate and let that sit somewhere in the direct airflow inside the refrigerator. Fresh coffee grounds work much the same way, simply place them\n\ton a plate and set them somewhere in the direct airflow inside the refrigerator on a shelf. Alternatively, you may choose to use some activated\n\tcharcoal, which can be found in local hardware stores or grocery stores.\n\t\n\tSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tWhat to do if the Smell in Your Refrigerator Will Not go Away\n\t\n\tIf after a few days you have not noticed the smell disappear, the problem may be a little deeper. The odor could be coming from the evaporator\n\tarea in your freezer, in which case we suggest using a professional to do a proper cleaning on that component. We also suggest checking your air filter, as some models come equipped with one built right into your appliance. Generally, these need to be replaced every 6 months, so you may be\n\tin need of a replacement.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\t\n\tHow to Keep Your Refrigerator Smelling Fresh\n\t\n\tThere are a few simple things you can do to ensure your refrigerator continues to smell fresh:\n\t\n\t\n  Keep your refrigerator at the ideal temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This will reduce food spoilage and prevent the growth of bacteria.\n  Use airtight containers when packaging up leftovers.\n  Mark the date on the leftovers and throw-out if not consumed in a few days.\n  Never over-pack your refrigerator because this can impede on proper air flow inside the appliance.\n  Do a weekly check of food items and throw out anything past-due on a regular basis.\n  Keep the refrigerator air filter up-to-date if your refrigerator model uses an air filtering system.\n \n\n\nHow to Clean a Stainless Steel Refrigerator\n\nNow that the inner part of your refrigerator is sparkly clean and smelling fresh, it is time to tackle the outside. Stainless steel refrigerators\n are a super trendy look these days, and we do not think that trend is going anywhere, any time soon. They require very specific maintenance to\n ensure you don’t damage the stainless-steel finish.\n\n\n\n\n \n What to Avoid When Cleaning Stainless Steel:\n \n \n  Avoid materials that may scratch the surface, such as sponges with a rough side or scotch pads. We suggest a microfiber cloth if possible. \n  Avoid cleaning in a circular motion. Stainless steel has a grain, much like wood does, so cleaning in a circular motion could create scratches. Make sure you clean with the grain.\n  Never use chlorine bleach on stainless steel. This chemical will cause a reaction with the stainless steel material, causing rust.\n  Avoid anything that has a sticky substance, such as post-it notes or tape. If a mark has formed because a sticker has been left for too long, try using a mixture of soap and water or a product specific to removing adhesive film. \n  Never use paper towel. They are often too coarse and can scratch the surface.\n\n\nNow it’s time to give it a good thorough clean with a mild soap and water solution. Once it has been cleaned thoroughly, you will want to give it a good rinse with just pure water to get rid of any soap residue. Next, use a stainless-steel polish over the entire surface, working with the grain.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \n  We hope these cleaning tips helped you solve your smelly fridge and left the outside shining like new!

But did you know that many people will go their whole lives without ever knowing the proper rules and methods for effectively loading their dishwasher for best results? Not only can improper loading cause issues with getting your dishes properly cleaned, it can also cause damage to your machine and the dishes you load. In our experience, many people who report a broken or malfunctioning dishwasher are often just not using their dishwasher correctly, leading to negative symptoms. With our tips and tricks, you’ll learn how to make sure your dishes come out clean and shiny every time which can save you time AND money! \n\n \n \n\n\nWhile all dishwashers are basically the same, some manufacturers have different advice for how to load the racks. Make sure to first consult the user manual or owner's guide for your model and follow their instructions.\n\nBottom Rack\n\nWith most dishwashers, the larger items go on the lower rack. These items include plates, large bowls, cutting boards, casserole dishes etc. The key to making sure everything gets cleaned properly is to make sure there is enough space between the items so that water can freely circulate. \n\nYou also need to make sure that items don’t protrude below the wire rack as they could interfere with your sprayer or become damaged. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTry not to put plastic items on the bottom rack. Plastic items are more sensitive to the heat from the heating element and could melt.\n\nMake sure to check the edges of your dishes, if any are chipped or have sharp edges, be careful when putting them on the rack so you don’t cause damage to your rack, which could lead to a rust problem.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nCutlery Basket\n\nPlace items that are prone to nesting together – such as spoons – in different areas. You can also alternate your utensils handle down and handle up to keep them from nesting. If items like these stick together, they may not get cleaned on the front side of one or the backside of the other.\n\nSaveEmbed Image   \n\nIf you have sharp items such as knives or forks, avoid dropping them into your cutlery basket. Doing so could potentially damage the bottom of your basket and the sharp items could go down through the bottom of your basket and interfere with the bottom spray arm. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nUpper Rack\n\nLoad glassware, smaller bowls and cutlery that may not fit properly on the bottom rack – such as large, sharp knives - onto the upper rack. You also may find that plastic bowls that don’t fit well on the bottom rack, will fit nicely on the upper rack. Keep in mind that if you place a large item over other items, the large item may not get a good wash.\n\nMost upper racks are designed to let bowls fit down through the center. Typically, you’ll see the tines pointed in one direction towards the back of the dishwasher and the opposite direction towards the front – this lets you place bowls facing toward the center. When loading multiple bowls, make sure they have enough space between them to ensure they all get a good cleaning.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nThe rest of the rack is designed to handle mugs and glasses. Try to avoid placing glassware or mugs over the tines. If items rest or sit on tines, the tines may leave a stain on the bottom of your dish.\n\nMost racks will have something designed for long stemware to keep items such as wine glasses from wobbling around and breaking. Make sure to place your stemware in the proper spot to avoid any damage.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n \nBonus Tips\n\nTo ensure your dishes come out sparkling, always use a good quality detergent – whether it’s a liquid or tablet – and always store your detergent in a cool dry place.\n \nPeriodically check the filters in your dishwasher to make sure they are clean and functioning properly.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nCheck your spray arms to make sure the holes aren’t plugged with any items. If any of the holes are plugged, you will need to clear them.\n\nSaveEmbed Image \n \nFinally, don’t wash your dishes before you wash your dishes. Scraping off any large food items should be sufficient. Dishwashing detergent is typically a harsh chemical and if there is no food soil to react to, it will react with your dishes and potentially cause serious damage.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nProperly vs. Improperly Loaded Dishwasher: How Much Difference Does It Make?\n\nWe took two identical dishwashers to demonstrate what happens when you don’t properly load the dishwasher versus the outcome of a properly loaded\n dishwasher. For the properly loaded dishwasher we kept lots of space between the dishes and plated all the cutlery with the dirty end up. The same goes\n for the upper rack. We left lots of space and made sure not to block the sprayer arm. For the unproperly loaded dishwasher we put no effort into the\n organization of dishware. We just crammed everything in wherever we could fit it. We shoved all the cutlery possible into the cutlery basket without \n any effort.\n \n Before we began our experiment, we made sure to purge the hot water line. This is an important step because typically your first fill will only use\n cold water that is in the water lines. Pick the closest faucet to your dishwasher (usually the kitchen sink), turn on the hot water until it is as hot as\n it will get, turn it off and start the dishwasher. We added detergent into the dispensers of both dishwashers and began our experiment!\n \n Once both dishwashers completed their cycles, we checked for the results. The properly loaded dishwasher looked excellent. All the dishes were sparkly\n clean as you would expect. When we checked the improperly loaded dishwasher the results were not so great. Food was still caked on, as not leaving enough\n space between the dishes didn’t allow for the water to circulate properly and give us our desired results. Our experiment was a success – it DOES matter\n how you load your dishwasher! Check out the video below to see the results for yourself.\n \n \n\n\n  \nThat's all there is to it! Follow these tips and basic principles of dishwasher loading, and you'll get a sparkling clean load of dishes every time, and get a much longer life out of your kitchenware and your dishwasher. Did you know that we carry a wide range of dishwasher parts. If you discover any parts in your dishwasher that need replacing, which may happen over time due to any of the above reasons, use your model number and browse what we have to see if we have the right part for your machine.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Keeping your microwave clean not only makes it look great, but it also helps prevent bacteria buildup on the inside, which makes it safer for you. Follow our quick and easy guide to get microwave looking like new again!\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \nTo clean your microwave you will need:\n\n\t\n\t\tA microwave-safe cup with a handle\n\t\tA couple of tablespoons of white vinegar or dish soap\n\t\tA soft cloth\n\t\tGlass cleaner\n\t\tWater\n\t\tA dry cloth or paper towel\n\n\t\n\n\nCleaning the interior\n\nCleaning the inside of your microwave is simple! Pour a cup of water and a couple of tablespoons of white vinegar (you can use dish soap if you don’t have white vinegar) into a microwave safe cup and put that in the microwave for 2 or 3 minutes. Using a mug with a handle is the best option here to ensure you can remove the mug as safely as possible.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDon’t heat the mixture to a boil, just make sure the mixture gets hot. Let the steam collect on the interior walls of your microwave. Remove the mug, being careful not to burn your hands on the cup. Do not pour the mixture out yet as you will need it to clean the exterior of your microwave.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nNext, take out the microwave’s glass tray and carriage - be careful as the tray may be hot or have liquid on it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n   \nThe interior will have moisture accumulated on it from the vinegar and water solution. Take a clean cloth and wipe down the interior, removing any food residue that has accumulated. This may take a little bit of elbow grease depending on how firmly the food has stuck to the microwave. If you need more liquid, simply dip the cloth into the cup containing your vinegar and water solution and keep scrubbing!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhen cleaning the mica plate, make sure not to use any harsh chemicals and to be gentle as the plate is typically very fragile.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhen the inside is clean, dry it with a fresh cloth or paper towel. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nNext, clean the carriage and glass tray with dish soap and warm water. \n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \n\nWhile you have these items out, check for any damage. If you find damage, replace the broken part. \n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nOnce the glass tray and carriage have been washed, thoroughly dry them and place them back in the microwave.\n \nSaveEmbed Image\n\nCleaning the exterior\nDip a fresh soft cleaning cloth into the vinegar and water solution and then wipe down the exterior of your microwave. \n\nSaveEmbed Image \n\nIf you have a countertop model, make sure to pull the microwave far enough forward that you can clean the back too.\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nTo clean the door, spray some glass cleaner onto a cloth or paper towel and carefully wipe the surface and controls. \n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf you happen to find some damaged or worn-out parts while cleaning your microwave, remember that we carry a huge range of  microwave repair parts.

If you're sure the gas isn't a problem, then follow along. You can view our video guide here, or our written guide below, to find out why your leaf blower won't start:\n\n\n \n \n \n\nClogged Carburetor\nIf the engine is sputtering\nor stopping as soon as you try to start it up then\nyou may have an issue with the\ncarburetor. The carburetor is an essential part of any small engine that mixes air and fuel in the appropriate ratio to achieve combustion. It also requires regular maintenance and occasional replacement in order to run at its best. Clean out your carburetor using carburetor\ncleaner and try starting the engine\nagain. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan. Otherwise, you may need to disassemble the\ncarburetor for a more thorough cleaning, or replace the part if it is faulty.\n\nDirty or Defective Spark Plug\nThe spark plug is a common problem area because even a dirty spark plug can prevent the machine from starting at all. Take out your spark plug, clean it, and then test it using a spark plug tester. If it doesn't seem to be working properly or appears damaged, then you'll need to give it a proper clean, or more likely, replace it. Spark plugs require regular seasonal maintenance and replacement to keep your machine working well for many years.\n\n\nIgnition Coil\nIf you still don't get any spark after replacing the spark plug you'll need to access the ignition coil\nand inspect it for any damage or wear. Check your user manual if you're unsure of how to find this part in your machine. \nYou should also measure the air gap between the magnetic coil and the\nflywheel. If it isn't to the manufacturer's\nspecifications you may not get a proper\nspark, and your leaf blower won't be able to start. \n\n\nDefective Rewind Spring\nThe rewind spring is an often-overlooked mechanism that is necessary for the starter rope to work. If the rewind spring is broken\nthe starter rope won't be able to recoil into the pulley, which you should be able to notice upon inspection.\nInspect it for damage and replace it if\nnecessary.\n\n\nRecoil Starter Pulley\nIf this is malfunctioning or broken you\nwon't be able to pull-start the leaf\nblower, so there won't be the necessary connection between the starter rope and the engine. Check your user manual if you're unsure of where this part is located in your machine. Inspect it for damage and repair or replace it if necessary.\n\n\n\nClogged  Spark Arrestor\nThe spark arrestor goes through a lot of wear and tear and can get\nclogged up with soot and caked-on carbon. If you're unsure of how to clean a spark arrestor, do a bit of research online before attempting. Deep cleans may require you to use high heat tools like a blow torch, which not everybody is comfortable with. If you're not comfortable working with high-heat, we would recommend taking this to a professional. If you're not able to get all the gunk off or unable to do this process for whatever reason, you made need to replace it.\n\nAfter investigation these six key problem areas, we find we are usually able to solve our leaf blower problems and hopefully you will too. We hope this advice will get your blower up and running in time to clear those ever-growing piles of fall leaves. If you're planning to do any repairs to these common and easily replaced parts along the way, make sure you have all the necessary leaf blower parts.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

It’s a perfect way, no matter the season, to take a few steps out of your back door and feel more at peace with the world, get close to nature, and meditate and ruminate on life for as long as you have before duties and obligations drag you back inside. Everyone with a bit of space in their backyard should have a firepit.\nBut, firepits have to be right for you, and your budget There are a range of options that can be bought from department or hardware stores, and these tend to run the spectrum of “crap” to “beautiful”, with prices that match accordingly. Go cheap, and you’ll find yourself with a firepit constructed of thin metal that rusts and deteriorates inside of a season. If you’re looking to spend upwards of $1,000 on your firepit, you can find some pretty amazing hand-made, thick, solid firepit constructions out there, and if you’ve got the money on hand, we say go for it!\nThen there’s the other option, which is to do it yourself! There are endless home-made firepit builds out there, and most of them are simple to construct. Whether you’re making your firepit from brick, stone, or metal, a good starting point is a vessel for your fire to live in, and not many better building blocks for this vessel exist out there than the washer drum from a front-load washing machine! These drums are the perfect size and shape, they’re usually perforated to let out light and allow the fire to breathe, and they’re good-looking and constructed of thick, high-quality metal that will stand up to many seasons of outdoor fires.\nWhether you have an old front-load washing machine, or you happen to find one on the side of the road (happens more often than you would think!), or are able to acquire a broken down/used washer for a good price, using a washer drum as the basis for your backyard firepit is smart and thrifty. It’s also incredibly easy! So easy, in fact, that the majority of this article is going to detail the most difficult part of the process, which is accessing and removing the drum from your washer so that it can begin its new life as your backyard firepit.\nWatch the following video or read our step-by-step guide below to get your washer drum functioning as a firepit.\n\n \n \n \n\nBefore Getting Started\nRegardless of the brand, most front-load washers are constructed in a similar fashion, so the disassembly procedures will be very similar. However, there may be some small differences between the washer we worked on to put together this guide, and your washer, so keep this in mind as you follow the instructions. Use common sense; ultimately, our goal here is to break the washer down enough to access the drum to make our firepit. It’s a little more work than it may seem, but nothing that can’t be handled in less than 30 minutes of work!\nBefore beginning any appliance repairs or disassemblies, always ensure you have disconnected power to your appliance first.\n\nWasher Disassembly Step-by-Step\nYou’ll want to begin at the back of the washer, firstly so that you can remove the brackets that secure the top as well as the access panel on the lower portion of the back so that we can access the shaft and motor assembly on this style of washer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRemove the retaining screws on the top brackets, pull the top back and remove it completely, and set it aside. While you’re at the back of the washer, remove the access panel by removing the retaining screws, and lift the panel up so that the tabs release on the bottom and top. Set the panel aside.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf your washer is a direct drive version, you’ll need to now remove the rotor that is attached to the shaft, using a soft-faced mallet to get it started.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nNext, we’ll slide the rotor off the shaft, keeping in mind that the inside is covered with magnets so it will want to stick. Once pulled off, it can also be set aside.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOur next step will be to shift our focus to the front, where we need to remove the console and then the front panel. Start by removing the detergent drawer by sliding it as far forward as it will go, release the locking tab, pull out the drawer, and discard it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThere’s also typically one or two screws that are hidden in behind the detergent drawer, which you will want to remove.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTypically, with this style of front load washer, you’ll have a single retaining screw on the back that goes into the plastic console, which will need to be removed. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWe will also need to disconnect the wire harness connectors that feed through from our main harness into our console.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWith those removed, we’re going to lift up on the top edge of the control panel to unhook the plastic tabs holding it in place. Once you’ve unhooked these, you should be able to tip the control panel forward, pull the harnesses through, and it will be removed and ready to be discarded or set aside.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWith any front load washer you will typically have a door boot or door bellows, so before you can remove the front panel, you will need to disengage these first. There’s normally a wire band that wraps around, with a spring located, typically in the bottom area. You will want to pry that out, pull the band off, and then release the door bellows and push it back inside the washer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWith the bellows released, your next step will be to take out the two screws that secure the door lock assembly to the front panel, then push that back into the washer. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe style of front load washer that you’re working on likely has a little access door at the bottom, which will need to be opened up. This will expose a screw that secures the retainer in place, which will need to be taken out, as well as flipping down the little drain tube so it will fit through the opening. Then you should be able to remove the door and bracket in one piece, exposing a single screw at the bottom that secures the front pane to the support bracket, which should also be removed.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe next step is to remove the retaining screws across the top. Once we’ve done that, you can take the whole front panel assembly aside, which will give you a much better view of the internal construction of the front load washer. As with all front load washers, you should have a rear half of the outer tub, and a front half, joined at a seam and connected by either bolts or push-on clips, depending on your model.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe front half of the outer tub will have the door bellows and typically some counterweights mounted to it. So, what you need to do before separating both halves of those tubs, is to disengage anything that is attached to the front portion, such as hoses, wire harnesses, and bolts that secure the counterweights.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOn our model, we had a heater located on the front half of the outer tub, which we needed to disconnect the wire harnesses to.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOur model also had its front and rear outer tub held together by bolts, so our next step was to remove all of those, followed by removing the shocks, which are held together to the base frame and the outer tub with a hinge pin. Compress the locking tabs and pull the pin out. Repeat on the left side and anywhere else pins need to be removed.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nYou’re almost done! Our particular model had a wire harness attached to the top of the front outer tub, so if yours does too, that will need to be removed.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe only thing that is connecting the front and rear halves of the outer tub at this stage should be a set of suspension springs. You should be able to see where they hook through a hole in both the back and front tabs. You will need to remove the spring by gently prying it off and lowering it down. After doing one spring and before doing the other, we suggest that you separate the two halves of the tub, hook the spring into the back half, and hang it back up again. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOn the left-hand side of the cabinet, there will be some other devices in the way. You can choose to remove the screws and lift the whole assembly out of the way, but you may also find that by popping the cover off, you can sneak in with a pair of locking pliers and get it out, without having to remove everything else that’s in the way. Lower the spring and reach in from the front to disconnect it.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nNow that the front and rear half of the outer tub have been separated, you can pull the front half out through the front of the washer, and discard it.\n \n SaveEmbed Image\n \nWith the front half out of the way, you now have access to your spinner. If the shaft in the spinner is not rusted into the bearings, you should be able to easily slide it out through the front. Get a grasp with both hands, make sure the washer doesn’t move, and pull it forward. Your firepit has been freed!\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \nNext you’ll want to remove the bolts that secure the spinner shaft assembly to the basket. Once those are removed, the spinner shaft assembly should lift right off, and can be discarded.\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n\nWith the spinner assembly out of the way, you will flip your drum over. Our brand of washer had a plastic balance ring around the perimeter of the wash basket/drum, held in place with some screws. Remove these if present, to get rid of the plastic, which is no good for a fire!\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \nThe only thing remaining is the baffles inside of the drum. Our model used a single screw to hold these in place, so we removed that. With the screw removed, slide the baffle up until it lines up with the four keyhole slots, then lift it off and discard.\n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \n Get Burning!\nVoila! Your firepit awaits. From here, you might want to polish up your washer drum, depending on its condition, but it’s ready to be placed anywhere safe and build a fire in.\nYou may choose to use this washer drum to form the base of a more complicated and ambitious firepit build; like building a brick wall around it for safety, which is great. The good thing about these washer drums is that they are versatile, and you now have the building blocks for a much more expensive looking firepit.\nFor us, though, we’re impatient, so we stuck to basics. We scouted a spot that’s safe and away from overhanging trees and structure, put down some patio stones, and we were in business! \n\n SaveEmbed Image\n \nHopefully, this guide helps you quickly and easily liberate the drum from that broken down old washer and get it into the backyard as a firepit you can start making memories around!

It’s a bit of a chore, but with our advice, we hope we can make it as easy for you as possible. Keeping your gutters clean and properly maintained isn't a glamorous job, but it's very important. Gutters work hard to keep all of that rainwater away from your home and foundation, where it can cause serious damage. If you’d like to view our video guide you can here, or read the rest of our written guide below:\n\n For a quick, simple guide, please take a look at our video here. Or view our full text guide below.\n \n \n \n\nCleaning Your Gutters\nThe most straightforward and cost-effective way of cleaning your gutters will be to purchase or make your own tool to scoop out all the leaf and gunk build-up. If you’re interested in making a scoop yourself, we recommend using a plastic jug such as a vinegar bottle and carefully cutting it into the right shape. As long as your scoop can fit into the gutter, and not damage it, then you’re good to go.\n\nSecure your ladder, climb up and scoop out whatever gunk is inside. Different areas will likely have different types of debris build-up,  depending on the trees that tend to be in your area and their proximity to your gutter, so be mindful as to what your cleaning needs are. Once it’s all cleaned out, climb down, move your ladder over, and repeat the process.\n\nTo remove sediment and flush out your gutter, get yourself a long garden hose with a spray nozzle at the end of it. If you need to, take out your gutter protector. Then simply spray towards the direction of the downspout until all the sediment has been rinsed away. Ensure that you monitor the output of the downspout as you flush the remnants away, as any disrupted or unusual flow will indicate potential blockage.\n\nProtecting Your Gutters from Debris\nNow that the gutters are nice and clean and free of debris and build up, let's look at how we can protect them. To prevent gutter build up and make your next gutter cleanout way easier than the one before it, there are a few common protection methods.\n\nOpen foam-style gutter protectors are a common option. These fold and lay flat in your gutter, and allow water to pass through. However, small organic material and debris such as pine needles or dust can become trapped in the foam and cause clogging. Cleaning will be difficult if the filter is left out for too long. If you can’t clean out the clogged materials then you will need to replace it.\n\nRigid plastic filters should feature large perforations on one side and a finer mesh screen on the other. The mesh screen will prevent most small items from passing through. However, dust, sand, and pine needles could still be an issue. These protectors are easy to install and fairly easy to clean. They will last significantly longer than a foam filter.\n\nFlexible plastic filters are an inexpensive and easy option, as well as quite effective. These screens have large perforations which will allow smaller items to get through, however, it will block larger items such as leaves. What makes these an easy option is that the filter can be cleaned without removing it from the gutter. As long as you don’t have a large build-up of leaves, you should be able to flush debris out easily with a hose. You may not even need to take it off to clean your gutter!\n\nProtecting Your Downspouts\nYou can also find several types of protectors for your downspout. Again, your decision will depend on your needs. A simple plastic protector will keep out most debris, however, you may want to look into a protector specifically built for leaves if this is an issue for you, as despite their useful hoods, most of these styles of protectors have gaps large enough that leaves can sneak through.\n \nAnother common style is the bendable aluminum protector, which is inexpensive and very easy to use. It's flexible enough that you can form it to any shape of downspout, be it round or rectangular. Always keep an eye on the perforations in your downspout protector, as this is the most important feature. Smaller holes in these protectors will block more debris but clog faster, while larger holes will allow water to pass through easily but may not filter out small debris.\n\nOf course, every home is different but these tips should get you one your way. If you expect smaller debris like pine needles or dust, then go for a tighter mesh option. If it's just leaves you're worried about, then any basic plastic or metal filter will do the trick. \n\nAnd that's all there is to it. As you can see, prior preparation and a few cheap or homemade gutter protectors can take the hard work out of gutter maintenance in the future. If you have anything in your home or garden that needs fixing this fall, be sure to check out our huge range of repair parts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Clothes coming out a bit wet? There may be a way to fix that. A good thorough cleaning will help your dryer work good as new.\nYou can either read our written guide below or follow along with Steve in our video guide here:\n \n \n \n\nHere are some items you MAY need for this job:\n\nMulti-Surface Cleaner\nSoft Cotton or Microfiber Cloth\nHot Water\nSoap\nBaking Soda\nVinegar\nAutomotive Wax\nSoft Bristle Brush\nCrevice Tool/Vacuum\nLong, Slender Brush\nPutty Knife\nAir Compressor\n\n\n\n\nCleaning the Exterior of the Dryer \nUse your favorite spray-on multi-surface cleaner and soft cotton or microfiber cloth, and wipe the exterior surface. If knobs are very dirty, you can remove them to clean in behind or to clean the knobs separately. Try soaking them in hot water and soap, or a baking soda/vinegar combination and rinse for a thorough cleaning. \n\nInspecting and Cleaning the Lint Filter \n Remove the lint filter, remove the link and inspect the mesh for any build-up of fabric softener. If there is build-up, soak the filter in hot water with soap. You may require a soft bristle brush to get it all off.\n\nTips for Cleaning Electronic Dryer Surfaces\nFor dryers with electronic controls we will need to be extra cautious when cleaning the console area of the machine. Don't go overboard on the amount of liquid you use, and make sure to dry thoroughly.\n\nCleaning the Interior of the Dryer \nOpen up your dryer door. The first thing you'll want to do is inspect the tumbler or \"drum\" for any signs of stains,  or any small objects that may be stuck. Remove any objects, and use the appropriate cleaner for whatever you are needing to wipe down. When cleaning the interior of your dryer, do not use any petroleum-based products as those types of chemicals can damage the painted surfaces.\n\nHow to Clean the Lint Filter Area \nNext we want to open up the lint filter area. Look into the opening and see if there's any lint build up inside. You can remove it using a long slender brush to first loosen the lint, and then a vacuum to suck it up. \nSome dryers will have a lower access panel which will allow you to do an even deeper clean, by inspecting deep inside the dryer for lint build-up. It's important to remove as much lint as possible, as it is highly flammable.\n\nDeep Cleaning Lint\nLint build-up is a key culprit in restricting your efficiency. If you're still having problems drying your clothes, then do a deep clean on your machine to remove as much lint as possible. You can remove the drum and outer door panel to access the interior dryer parts. Here you can get a good view of the amount of lint inside your machine, and can give it a thorough deep clean. Pay attention to the drive motor as that can build up with lint and cause overheating. You can vacuum lint out of your machine, and use compressed air to blow some of it out.\n\nHow to Increase Air Flow to Maximize Efficiency \nIf a machine does not have a good airflow it can lead to faster lint build-up and overall less efficiency. To get a better airflow, ensure that your door seals are in good shape to avoid leakage. Check that they are tight and have no rips, and replace if damaged. Also check the dryer drum seal (typically attached to the front and rear of the drum) for any signs of wear or cracking. Finally inspect the vent itself for any damage.\n\nNow that you've completed your cleaning just put everything back together and test it out! If your appliance needs repair, make sure you have all the  dryer parts you need!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

You may think you're going crazy, but you might be right! Washers can actually trap small objects including socks in places you can't see. With just a few easy steps you can uncover a treasure trove of socks and other valuable items that may have been swallowed by the front-load washer monster. Take 15 minutes to solve the mystery once and for all in your home. You can watch our video guide on this subject below, or read our written guide. \n\n \n \n \n\nCommon items to lose in a front-load washer:\n\n\nCoins\nNails, screws, bobby pins, jewelry (small metal objects)\nSocks\nBank cards\nBra wires\n\n\nThese items are small enough that they can get between the door barrel and inner basket, or fall into the pump area where they can get caught in the trap or filter or even the pump itself. Items should be removed ASAP, as any foreign object can damage the appliance. You can figure out what kind of object is stuck and where it is, by listening to your washer.\n\nTypes of sound:\n\nScraping\nMetal object between door bellows and inner basket is indicated by a scraping noise. To locate the culprit, use a flashlight, and check the basket for protrusions. You may be able to remove the item this way with needle-nose pliers. If it is outside the tub, then check between the door bellows and inner basket.\n\nClicking/clinking\nThis would tend to indicate a metal object inside of drum baffle. The gap may be large enough that a coin or other small object has snuck inside. Check your owner's manual for advice on how to remove your appliance's drum baffle and get the object out. Your baffle may be removable just by pulling on it, or it may have a retaining screw which needs to be undone. Each washer is subtly different here, so it's best to go with your manufacturer's directions.\n\nScuffing sound\nIndicates an article of clothing between the inner and outer basket. Check between the door bellows and the basket for items. \nIf you look here and don't find anything, the item it may be stuck between the inner and outer drum. Check your owner's manual for information on how to open your washer. Each machine is slightly different, but it is likely you will be able to remove the cover and fill hose to be able to see the outside of the basket. Rotate the basket until the foreign object appears, and then pull it out.\n\nNoise from bottom of washer\nSomething is in the pump area, and the filter must be removed in order to access it. This one is a bit of a pain, and again, we recommend checking your owner's manual for full details on your specific model. Remove the front panel to access the drain pump and filter. Set a bucket in front of the filter to ensure no water gets on the floor. Remove the filter, and you should see the foreign object. Also, check inside of the filter housing. With the item removed, you can reinsert the filter and the cover. \n\n\nWith these tips you should be able to find that missing sock in no time! While you're checking your washer, it may be a good time to do some maintenance. Just make sure you have the right parts.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

These machines go through a lot of wear and tear, so every so often it's good to give it a nice once over. If you're pulling out your saw after months of storage, or if you're just noticing it's not as smooth at it used to be, then take a look at these key areas.\n\nYou can view our video here or our written guide below:\n \n \n \n\nAir filter\nRemove the air filter cover, and then the air filter. You can clean the air filter with compressed air. If your filter is a metal type you can use a soft wire brush. Inspect your filter for damage, and if it is damaged, replace it. \n\nSpark plug\nRemove the spark plug and inspect it for gunk, specifically carbon buildup. You can easily clean away these deposits by using a soft wire brush. However if the spark plug is damaged or the electrodes are burnt, you’ll want to replace it.\n\nCarburetor\nRemove the carburetor and give it a thorough cleaning with a carb cleaner. Check for damage, and replace if necessary.\n\nSpark Arrestor \nPull out the spark arrestor, which is typically a small mesh green. Use a tooth brush or a fine wire brush to remove any deposits or carbon build up, and then reassemble.\n\nFuel Filter\nIf you’ve left your chainsaw out for more than three months, it may have a clogged fuel filter. Drain and remove the fuel filter from the gas tank, and inspect it for clogging and damage. Clean it up, reinsert it (or replace if damaged) into the tank and you’re good to go.\n\nGuide Bar\n\nUse a wrench to remove the nuts that hold the guide bar to the body of the chainsaw. Loosen the tensioning screw to allow slack in the chain and then remove it. Clean up any dirt or debris around the oil inlet hole on the guide bard as well as the oil way on the engine housing\n\nThe Chain\nKeeping your chain sharp and clean is important to getting the best performance out of your saw, as well as being important to safety. A dirty chain can cause kickbacks, which can result in serious injury. Remove your chain using the steps above and soak it in a bucket of soapy water. Use a soft bristle brush and gently scrub the entire chain clean. Before putting the chain back, try adding a light coating of oil to keep it running smooth.\n\nAnd that's all there is to it. Give your saw a quick test and it should be running smooth as ever. If you're planning to fix up your chainsaw a bit, make sure you have all the chainsaw parts you need.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

How to inspect a refrigerator's air inlet damper or baffle: The weather is heating up, which means it's extra important that your fridge is in working order. Nobody wants to be stuck with a warm fridge in the middle of the summer. A warm fridge can cause food to spoil more quickly than normal, costing you lots of money. The repair need not cost a fortune, either. Avoid the cost of a repair person and diagnose the problem and fix it yourself!\n\n You can follow along with our video guide, or view our repair article below\n \n \n \n\n Where is the problem? \n If your fridge is too warm, it is likely a problem with the air dampener/baffle/diffuser. This part balances the air flow from the evaporator fan housing. It regulates the amount of cold air entering the fresh food compartment. If the dampener or its connection to the control knob is broken, then you may not have enough cold air entering the fresh food compartment, resulting in higher than normal temperatures. Not good.\n\nHow to inspect a refrigerator's air inlet damper or baffle:\n\nDisconnect your refrigerator from the power source and open your refrigerator door to locate the damper or baffle. It will be found where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment. Check your owner's manual if you are not sure exactly where to find this. \n Take a look at the housing. The housing that the baffle or damper is encased in is often made of plastic with a Styrofoam lining and may have a foam seal to prevent air leakage. Check this area for any possible leakage. Care should be used when inspecting the housing to avoid damage to the seal or the Styrofoam.\nCheck the sensing bulb, if applicable. Some refrigerator models use a temperature sensing bulb attached to this control that will automatically adjust the control for changes in the interior temperature. Make sure that the sensing bulb is in the correct position and is not damaged. check your owner's manual for more information on how to find this part.\nAttempt to operate the control knob to verify that the linkage is intact and that it moves freely.\nIf the damper is stuck in the closed or nearly closed position or does not move freely, then you need a replacement air inlet damper or baffle.\n\n\n Checking these key areas will let you know what is wrong with your fridge, so you can know what needs to be replaced. Best of all, this symptom does not have a long list of parts that generally cause it, making it easy to identify that the air inlet damper or baffle is likely the one you need. Before starting any repairs, make sure you have all the parts you need.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Whether large or small, making the right preparations ahead of time can help your get-together\n run smoothly, and can also provide you some ever-important peace of mind that you've done what it takes to avoid the dreaded \n holiday disaster!\n \n One of the most important aspects to any family gathering, is the kitchen. It's where the food is prepared and stored,\n and often serves as a gathering place for your guests. When you have guests over, it's always a good idea to make sure\n your kitchen is prepared to host a group, and that can often center on the refrigerator. Your fridge plays an important role\n in the dinner party, as a place to store pre-made dishes and those brought by guests, to housing a variety of cold beverages\n for your guests to enjoy. When the party is done, the refrigerator is going to become the home of all your leftovers!\n That's why it's so important to make sure your fridge is neat, organized, and fully operational before your guests arrive.\n \n That's why we've put together this handy guide that will help you ensure your refrigerator is ready to go for any get-together.\n We'll go over some of the steps you'll want to take ahead of time, from removing old items and cleaning the refrigerator itself,\n to adjusting your shelving and your fridge's temperature so that everything is just right when your guests roll in!\n\n \n \n \n \n Getting Rid of Expired or Unused Items\n \n The first step in any refrigerator preparation project is to get rid of any items that you're not planning to eat. We've\n all been in the situation where we've left something in the refrigerator a little longer that we should, and any of these\n items that you come across should be discarded. Not only will they make your refrigerator look messy, but they can also \n result in unpleasant odors, and nobody wants that when guests are over! Removing and discarding these items also has the added\n benefit of making more room in your fridge for food and drinks that you'll want to keep cold\n \n Take a Refrigerator Inventory\n \nNow that you've managed to get rid of all your old and unwanted items, it's time to take a refrigerator inventory. Eliminating \nany food items that you don't plan on using makes it a lot easier to create a list of everything that will be stored in the\nrefrigerator when your guests arrive. A good way to perform a refrigerator inventory is to remove everything from the fridge and jot down \na list of everything that will be stored in your fridge come party time. Removing everything from the fridge will also give you a head start\non the cleaning process down the line. \n\nKnowing what will be in your fridge by the time the party starts will help you understandhow much room is available in the refrigerator,\nand prevent you from running into space issues if guests bring food or beverages that need to be refrigerated. When it comes to hosting\na dinner party, organization is the key! \n \n \n Give Your Refrigerator a Clean\nIt's time to get to the messy bit of your refrigerator organization task: cleaning. You've already emptied the refrigerator of all items\nwhen you did your refrigerator inventory, and this will make it easy to clean out the rest of the fridge. You'll want to use some household\ncleaning products to remove any stains or spills, and using an anitbacterial cleanser can also reduce the amount of harmful bacteria\nthat may be living on your refrigerator surfaces. Don't forget to remove any trays or baskets, and give those a thorough cleaning as well.\nIt's also a good idea to wipe down the door gaskets, as they are often clogged with dirt and grime. \n\nChange Your Refrigerator's Water Filter\n\nThis step won't be necessary for everyone, since not everyone has a water filter, and everyone changes their water filter at different intervals, but if it's been more than 6 months since you've last changed your water filter, it may be time to swap it for a new one. Changing the filter will ensure that the water that comes from your refrigerator's water dispenser will be properly filtered (and the ice that comes from the ice maker will be as well!), To find the water filter that's right for your refrigerator, check out our Water Filter Finder.\n \n Adjust Your Shelving and Get Organized\n In order to properly organize your refrigerator, you'll want to ensure that your shelves are at the correct height and orientation. \n Every fridge is a little bit different, so you'll have to work with what you have for this step. When adjusting your rack heights, it's important\n to consider what you'll be filling the refrigerator up with later. Will you be putting an entire box of beer or soda in the fridge? Well,\n it's probably important to leave one section with some extra space to accommodate that. Similarly, if you're planning on brining your \n turkey ahead of time, you'll need some additional space on one of the shelves in your refrigerator. Again, it's important to do what's right\n for YOU in this situation, as everyone's fridge and everyone's individual needs will be a little different!\n \n Adjust Your Refrigerator Temperature\n This step is one that people often forget or don't consider at all. When you have party guests, or even making a complicated meal\n in your kitchen day-to-day, it's a good idea to adjust your refrigerator's temperature to make things just a little bit colder. The reason \n for this is that if you have guests serving themselves beverages (or if you're doing the bartending), or you're adding and removing food\n items often, the refrigerator door will be constantly opening and closing. This can cause the refrigerator's temperature to rise slightly,\n and this can impact the refrigerator's ability to keep everything cold. If you lower the temperature of the refrigerator ever so slightly, \n you can compensate for the constant opening and closing of the door, and keep everything nice and cold for your guests!\n \n \n Like anything in life, there are always going to be a number of different ways that you can prepare your refrigerator for a gathering,\nand these are just some of the tips that we find work well for hosting a party. You're going to understand your own situation the best,\nso make sure that everything you do in preparation for your party suits your own needs. With these simple tips, you can rest assured that\nyou've done what you can to prepare for guests, and your holiday party will be a resounding success!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Recoil Starter2. Dirty or Damaged Spark Plug3. Clogged or Damaged Air Filter4. Clogged or Damaged Fuel Filter5. Using Gas that Has Gone Bad6. Restricted Carburetor There's nothing nicer on a warm spring day than the look and smell of a freshly trimmed lawn, but what do you do when your lawnmower won't start? This is a common symptom for a machine that has been sitting in the shed or garage all winter long, but don't panic, we've got you covered. The fix is usually an easy one, and can be solved with a list of six common parts and solutions. Follow along with our video guide, or the written guide below to get your lawn mower up and running again \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Recoil Starter\nA broken recoil starter will not be able to turn the engine over, which means it will not turn on. Remove the recoil starter, and inspect it for damaged components such as the pulley, housing, and spring. If any of these are broken, make sure to replace them. \n\n2. Dirty or Damaged Spark Plug\n Give your spark plug a look. If it is looking dirty then clean it off best you can, reinsert it and try again. If it's broken, time to replace it. Generally, the spark plug should be replaced regularly, often once a season depending on use, as part of regular maintenance. It's an inexpensive part that will keep your machine running much longer when regularly switched out.\n\n3. Clogged or Damaged Air Filter\nA clogged air filter can seriously reduce fuel efficiency, even causing the machine to not turn on. Take a look at your air filter. If it can be cleaned, then do your best to get all the gunk out. if you can't clean it out, or the filter is damaged it should be replaced. generally, we recommend replacing rather than cleaning your air filter. As with the spark plug above, these parts commonly become clogged and replacing the air filter is a cheap job that can prevent a lot of serious issues if taken care of every season.\n\n4. Clogged or Damaged Fuel Filter\n Fuel filters remove dirt and debris from the gas before it entered the carburetor. There are two main types of fuel filters: inline and in-tank. If either of these gets clogged, not enough fuel will enter the carburetor and the mower will not start. Make sure to replace this part once a year to avoid this problem, as with the above two regular culprits, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.. \n\n5. Using Gas that Has Gone Bad\n Many people don't realize that gas can go bad. Typically you'll see this if you leave your gas in a machine for a long period of time (like leaving that mower in your shed over the winter). Check and see if there is a layer of water on top of the fuel, as this is a sign that it has gone bad. If that's the case, then drain the engine completely and refill it with fresh fuel.\n\nTip: During the last mow of the season, add some fuel stabilizer to the tank and run the engine until the stabilizer gets into the carburetor. This will prevent many issues the following spring. \n\n6. Restricted Carburetor\nYour carburetor needs some cleaning now and again. Give your carburetor a once over with carburetor cleaner, or disassemble it to give a more thorough cleaning. You can also install a new carb kit to replace any damaged internal parts. \n\n Hopefully with these tips, your mower will be back in working order and you will be well on your way to a beautiful lawn. Have fun, be safe, and make sure you have all the parts you need.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

In this article, we will share our top tips to make your room air conditioner work more efficiently, which will help you save on your energy bill. \n\nYou can view our video here or our written guide below:\n \n \n \n\nPlacement\n\nOne of the most effective ways to make your AC unit more efficient is to ensure it is properly positioned in the room.\nFor window units: try to position your AAC so you get the maximum airflow into your room, and avoid placing it in a window that gets direct sunlight.\n\nIf the window that you place your AC unit does receive direct sunlight, it will make the AC warm up and therefore have to work harder to cool your room.\n\nAlternate Cooling\n\nYou should also avoid using your room's air conditioner in the evening or at night, and instead opt for a fan, or the \"fan\" setting on your air conditioner. Any time you use an alternate cooling source like a fan, you will end up saving money.\n\nWhen Not to Use Your Air Conditioner\n\nAvoid using your AC if you are running any kind of heat-generating device. Specifically, when using a stove or oven, opt for a fan instead of an AC. It will be more effective and less wasteful.\n\nAir Conditioners vs Dehumidifier\n\nMany people don't know that Air Conditioners also remove humidity from the air, so there's no need to run a dehumidifier in addition to your AC in a room.\n\nWall Mount vs Window Mount\n\nIf you have a choice, the wall-mounted unit is typically more efficient than a window-mounted unit. This is due to the placement in the room. Cold air drops, and wall-mounted units are typically placed higher on the wall which gives better air circulation and makes the unit more efficient.\n\nUsing an AC in Cooler Weather\n\nIt's never a good idea to run an air conditioner when the outside temperatures are near 65 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. the refrigerant used inside of your AC will need to rise in temperature during its cycle and a cooler outside temperature prevents this process from happening easily. Therefore the air conditioner needs to run longer to achieve the same temperature.\n\nProper AC Size\n\nMake sure to always get the right AC for the size of your room. If you're buying an AC, look in the product description to see what the recommended room size is for the product. If your AC unit is too large for the room, you will typically get a short-cycling condition. When this happens, the air conditioner turns on and off very frequently, which causes stress to the components and shortens their life. It's also not very energy-efficient and will end up costing you money.\n\nAir Conditioners use a measurement called \"BTU\" to determine the size of room appropriate for the specific model. You can estimate the BTU of your room by taking its width and length and multiplying by 25. \n\nIf you need some help finding the right AC for your home, check out our video here:\n \n \n \n\nKeep Your Air Conditioner Clean\nA clean air conditioner is an efficient air conditioner! Keeping the unit clean and maintained cab extend its life and helps your AC run more efficiently. These next couple of tips will show you some key areas to check.\n\nAir Filters\nAn air conditioner works by drawing air through the front of the unit through a filter, then an evaporator coil where the air chilled, and then blows through the exhaust event back into the room. If the air filter is dirty, it results in decreased airflow through your unit, which in turn means it won’t run as efficiently. Cleaning the filter is an easy task that should part of your regular cleaning schedule, especially if you have furry pets.\n\nEach style of room air conditioner (window, portable, or wall-mounted) has a removable filter that you can clean with warm soapy water. Window and wall units can be found by removing the front panel. On portable air conditioners, the filter is usually found at the back of the unit. Once the filters have been cleaned, thoroughly rinsed, and have dried completely, they can be placed back into the AC. If the filter is beyond cleaning, you can purchase a replacement to help keep your air conditioner running efficiently.\n\n \n \n\n\nEvaporator and Condenser Coils\n\nAlong with clean filters, keeping your evaporator and condenser coils clean and free of debris will help to make your air conditioner work more efficiently. The evaporator coils are found at the front of the unit behind the air filter, but the condenser coils on window and wall units are exposed to the elements are they’re outside your home, so they may accumulate more dirt and debris. The filter should trap most of the debris that could get into your air conditioner, but it’s important to inspect and clean your unit especially if it’s running continuously in the summer months.\n\nTo clean the cooling coils, you’ll need to remove the front panel and filter. You can then take a soft brush like a paintbrush to gently remove any debris. After it has been loosened a hand vacuum can be used to suck up all the dust. Be careful not to damage any of the fins, as this would also affect airflow.  To access the condenser coils and the fan, you’ll need to remove the cabinet from the air conditioner. Once again take a soft brush to the parts to loosen any debris, and then vacuum up. If there is really stubborn grime back there, liquid or foam commercial cleaning products are available. Be mindful not to get any of the electrical components like the control wet when using these to clean. Be sure to rinse thoroughly and allow the unit to dry completely before reassembling and turning back on.\n\n \n \n\n\nWith these tips you should hopefully see your energy bill come out a little lighter at the end of the month.

But did you know that by testing a few key parts, you can likely get your dishwasher back up and running again yourself? We'll take you through the key steps in testing the most likely parts to cause the \"won't start\" symptom; get up and running again using our video guide or the text guide featured below:\n\n \n \n \n\n Door Latch Or Door Latch Switch \nIf you cannot get your dishwasher to start, you could have issues the door latch or door latch switches. The door latch assembly holds the door closed when the machine is working, to stop water from leaking. This also includes the door latch switches that power the dishwasher controls. If the door cannot close properly to activate the door latch switches or if the switches are defective, then the dishwasher controls will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. Inspect the latch assembly including the switches.\n\nUsing a multimeter to test a dishwasher door latch assembly:\n\nRemove the power source from your appliance.\nTake the inner door panel off to get to the door latch assembly. It is typically located at the top of the door. Once found, verify that the  catch activates the door latch switches by pushing it into the assembly.\nIf activating the switches manually, remove the switches to check them for continuity. Using a multimeter set to Rx1, touch the probes to the terminals of the switch. You should get a reading of zero or almost zero.\nIf your reading is not zero or near zero, you will need to order a new door catch assembly.\n\n\nTimer or Electronic Control\n\nIf the door latch assembly is working and your dishwasher still is not starting, you should next examine the timer or electronic control. Dishwashers normally commence their cycles with a drain function to get rid of any water still in the tub.If you don't audibly hear this drain pump, the timer or electronic control could be the culprit. On dishwashers with manual timers, the timer supplies power to the pump motor, water inlet valve, heater circuit, and drain pump motor when required at the right time in the dishwasher cycle. The timer does this with a sequence of electrical contacts and a small motor that drives them. All of these are located in the timer housing. \nTesting a dishwasher timer with a multimeter:\n\nRemove power from your dishwasher for safety.\nFind the timer, likely in the control panel or behind the lower kick plate, and take it out.\nIf your timer contains lots of contacts and wires, you will need to use your wiring diagram to find the right contacts to test.\nUsing the Rx1000 setting on your multimeter, use the probes to touch the contacts. A working timer will range from 2000-3500 ohms, but this can vary. Use your appliance's owners' manual to find the right reading for your dishwasher.\nIf your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you may require a new timer.\n\n\nSelector Switch\nThe dishwasher's selector switch selects various options for the different cycles, for example, heated dry and heated wash cycles. The switch may be used in the motor or fill circuit, if the selector was defective or the buttons were not fully depressed, could cause the dishwasher to not start. Your first check should be whether the buttons are properly depressed. Then, using your schematics as a guide, the contacts can be checked using a multimeter:\nTesting a dishwasher selector switch with a multimeter:\n\nAs always, for safety, unplug your dishwasher.\nTake off the inner door panel of your dishwasher to find the selector switch. It will most likely be located on the control panel. Once found, make sure the switch is appropriately depressed. If it is, the next step is to test it, which will require you to remove it.\nSet your multimeter to Rx1, and test the terminals of the switch, checking each button individually. You should get an infinite reading if all is functional. Next, with the probes still on the terminals, press the terminal buttons you are testing. This should change your reading to zero. Do this test again for each of the individual buttons\nIf any of your readings do not produce the above results, you should consider a new selector switch.\n\n\nMotor Start Relay\nMultiple dishwashers utilize start relays on the main pump motor. This part supplies power to the motor start windings until it is running and has a moving plunger inside that operates a set of contacts. If your dishwasher will not start and you have tested the control circuit to the motor, the motor start relay may be the cause.\nTesting the motor start relay:\n\nRemove power to your dishwasher.\nLocate the motor start relay; usually found next to the pump. Take off your dishwasher's lower access panel to find the motor start relay. You will need to remove the motor start relay to commence testing it after you have located it.\nUse your wiring diagram, and get your multimeter out. Set it to Rx1 and start by testing the coil portion of the relay for continuity. You should get a reading of zero or almost zero. Next we are going to manually activate the relay by turning it upside down and letting the plunger drop. Once it is activated, touch the probes to the terminals of the relay. Again, you should get a result of zero or nearly zero when performing this test..\nIf you get different results to the ones above, you may need a new motor start relay.\n\n\nThermal Fuse\nSome dishwashers, particularly those that are electronic controlled, use a thermal fuse to protect the control board. The thermal fuse can usually be found on top of the circuit board assembly, attached to two wires. If the thermal fuse is defective, the control board won't get power and the result will be a dishwasher that doesn't start.\nTesting the dishwasher thermal fuse with a multimeter:\n\nThis is an electrical test, so as always, unplugging the dishwasher is crucial for safety.\nTake off the inner door to get to the control panel.Locate the thermal fuse and carefully disconnect the two wires and remove the thermal fuse.\nUsing your multimeter on the Rx1 setting, touch the contacts of the fuse with the probes. You should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero if there is continuity.\nIf your reading is different, it's time for a replacement thermal fuse.\n\n\nDrive Motor\nThe drive motor is the part that circulates the dishwasher water to wash the items inside. The timer or the electronic control supply the power to run the drive motor, along with a start relay. If your appliance will not start after the start relay sends power to the motor, the drive motor is likely the culprit for your symptom. A loud humming noise from the motor could also indicate a seized motor, meaning you will need to replace it.\nTesting the drive motor with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect the power from your dishwasher before commencing this test.\nTake off the lower access panel to find the drive motor. Carefully remove the wires attached to the drive motor and take it out in order to test.\nUsing a multimeter set to Rx1 and touch the probes to the motor's terminals. If working, the drive motor will produce a reading of zero or thereabouts. Next, test the ground connection by moving one of the probes to the bare metal housing of the motor. When you do this test, you  should get no reading.\nIf you get different results from these tests, your drive motor is defective and will need to be replaced.\n\n\nYou don't have to be an expert appliance repair person to diagnose and test a dishwasher that won't start. These top parts are easy to test using a few quick instructions and some basic safety precautions. We hope these instructions help you get your dishwasher up and running and saving on the cost of a pricey repair or the headache of having to buy a whole new appliance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Regular upkeep can help extend the life of your appliance, avoid unnecessary repair costs and save you from a lot of trouble down the road.\nWhen it comes to the laundry room, fires, floods, and fatal injuries are just a few of the potential dangers of a neglected washer or dryer. At PartSelect, we take safety very seriously and we want to make sure our customers are not only repairing their appliances safely but also using them safely.\nJoin Steve as he discusses some important washer and dryer maintenance tips that every homeowner should know. These four short videos will help you avoid costly and dangerous problems in the laundry room.\n\nLint Filter and Ducts\nA clogged lint filter or duct not only reduces performance, it's also a fire hazard. This is a vital area to check to avoid future disasters. \nIf you notice the following symptoms, it's likely a good time to check your filter and ducts:\n\n\nClothes taking a long time to dry\nClothes not fully drying\nThe outside of the dryer is very hot\n\n\n\nThese are all signs of improper air flow, and an indication you should check your filter and ducts.\n\n\nHoses\nThe hoses may not seem like an important thing to check, but a broken hose can lead to flooding. Nobody wants to walk into their laundry room and find a pool of water, so make sure to periodically check your fill hose and drain hose to ensure there are no cracks or abrasions. You'll also want to look out for soap suds, which may be a sign of leakage or corrosion which indicates the hose is too old. Any of these signs of damage are indications the hoses should be replaced. \n\nAnother element to look out for is the screen at the tap end of your fill hose. Make sure it's clean, and if it is damaged you should replace it.\n\n\nExtension Cords and Water Valves\nAs with all electronics, it's important to make sure your cords are intact. If your extension cord is broken it can lead to an electrical fire! Yikes! Fortunately, these are very easy to replace. For your washer and dryer, you should use an extension cord specifically made for these appliances, NOT a household variety.\n\nYour water valve should be turned off if you will be away from home for an extended period of time. Another useful tip is to avoid cranking the valve all the way open when turning it back on, as this may cause seizing.\n\n\nUse your Appliances Properly \nAlways follow the recommendations for your particular machine. Ignoring them can lead to disaster. Washing heavy items can damage your washer and oily clothes can explode or start a fire. If you're unsure of what you can put in your washer or dryer, check your owners manual or do research online.\n\nTry not to leave wet clothes in the dryer as this can become a fire hazard, and remember to leave the lid on your washer closed when not in use to avoid that \"musty\" washer smell.\n\n\n \n\nA few minutes of maintenance can save you hours of clean up or repairing later. Learn to look out for these common problem areas and you'll be way ahead of most consumers. Check on these key areas whenever you notice problems, or try to schedule some regular check-ups every few weeks, and your machines should keep running properly for a long time.

In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer.\n\nTo begin our repair, we’re going to start by completely defrosting the freezer. Please note that any of the repair guides and videos below are general information based on a fridge with freezer on top. The steps will vary based on your appliance model and location of the freezer (such as side-by-side or on the bottom). To find the instructions for your specific freezer, please search for the model number on our YouTube channel.\n\n \n\nHow to Remove Ice or Frost Buildup from Your Freezer\n\nThe first step is to unplug the appliance.\nRemove all food from the freezer and place it into a cooler or a spare freezer. You may want to remove food from the fridge as well. However, if you place frozen blocks inside and keep the fridge door shut the entire time, your fridge content may be fine during the repair.\nNote the location of the ice or frost buildup in your freezer, then leave the freezer door open to allow it to melt.\nAs the ice softens, gently remove it with a plastic spatula or cloth. Don’t use sharp or metal tools, which can damage the inner surfaces of your freezer.\nBased on where the buildup was located, follow the recommended inspections below to determine the issue and begin your repair.\nOnce your repair is complete, you can thoroughly clean and then plug the appliance back in. Wait until the freezer comes down to temperature before replacing your food items.\n\n\nFrost on the Freezer Walls or Door\n\nIf you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or replacing the gasket.\n\nHow to Fix a Freezer Door Gasket\n\nThe first step is to visually inspect the door gasket and surrounding door area for crumbs, spills, or items that may prevent the door from sealing properly. When inspecting the gasket, check to see if it is torn, warped, or otherwise damaged.\nIf the area is dirty, use a soft, damp cloth to clean up any spills or debris. If the gasket wasn’t damaged, your freezer door should now close properly, preventing any further frost buildup.\nIf the freezer door gasket is cracked or split, it will need to be replaced. The method may vary depending on your freezer model, but it typically requires few or no tools to complete.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nFrost (or Ice) on the Back Walls\n\nThe evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first. Modern fridges have a defrost mode that cycles on, which heats up the evaporator coils to remove any frost buildup. If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure.\n\nHow to Replace a Defrost Timer\n\nThe tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver.\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power from the appliance.\nThe defrost timer will be found within the control assembly inside the refrigerator. To remove the control assembly, you may need to remove shelving from the fridge, along with the lightbulb for easier access. You will then need to remove any bolts or screws holding the control housing in place and remove it from the fridge.\nPlace the control assembly on a work surface in order to remove the defrost timer from the housing. To remove the defrost timer, you will need to disconnect the wire harness, and you may need to remove bolts or screws if the timer is secured to the control housing. A flathead screwdriver can be used to remove the wire harness if it is not easy to pull off.\nThe old defrost timer can be discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the above steps.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nHow to Replace a Defrost Heater\n\nThe tools you will likely need may include a Phillips screwdriver, putty knife, needle nose pliers, and a quarter-inch nut driver.\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance.\nThe defrost heater is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part. Remove any screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place and carefully remove the panel from the freezer.\nLocate the wire harness for the defrost timer and disconnect it. Then remove any screws or bolts from brackets that may be used to hold the heater in place.\nThe old defrost heater can be removed and discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the steps above.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nHow to Replace the Defrost Thermostat\n\nReplacing a defrost thermostat requires a bit of electric work, so you will need a pair of wire cutters and strippers, and some electrical tape or heat shrink for this repair.\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance.\nThe defrost thermostat is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part. Remove any screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place, along with any wire harnesses, and carefully remove the panel from the freezer.\nWith the evaporator exposed, you should now be able to locate the defrost thermostat. Unclip the thermostat from the evaporator and then cut the wires that are connected to the thermostat. The old thermostat can now be discarded.\nOn the new thermostat, you can cut back some of the wires and strip some of the wire insulation. Join the two sets of wires together by using a wire nut or splice. Electrical tape can then be used to keep the two wires together.\nWith the new thermostat spliced together, it can be reinstalled back on the evaporator.\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\nIce on the Bottom of the Freezer\n\nIf there is solid ice (not frost) along the bottom of your freezer, there is likely a blockage in the drain hose, causing water to back-flow into the freezer and forming the layer of ice.  The line will need to be flushed out, which can be done with compressed air.\n\nHow to Fix a Blocked Drain Hose\n\nIf your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting power to the appliance.\nTo clear a blocked drain line, we recommend doing so through the external drain outlet with compressed air. This won’t require much air pressure; a bicycle pump will do the trick.\nWhatever was obstructing the drain line will be blown into the freezer compartment and can be cleaned up from there.\nWith the line now clear, the appliance can be plugged back in, and future ice melting from the defrost cycle should flow down the drain line instead of into the freezer.\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\nPractical Tips to Prevent Frost Buildup\n\nNow that we’ve solved the most common issues and parts that have caused frost build-up in your freezer and cleared it out, it’s time to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Fortunately, basic changes to some of your daily habits can help prevent future frost or ice buildup in your freezer. Since warm, humid air entering the freezer causes frost to form, following these tips can help prevent any issues:\n\nLimit how often you open the fridge and freezer door.\nKeep your unit organized so you can find what you need quickly. This is key to limiting how long the door is left open.\nEnsure the door is closed tightly after each use.\nDon’t place hot food in the freezer. Allow leftovers to cool down completely before storing.\nPromptly clean up any spills, which could prevent the door gaskets from sealing properly.\nA well-stocked freezer can help maintain a consistent temperature, but make sure it isn’t crammed to allow for proper airflow.\n\n\nBy following these use-and-care tips, you can ensure that your freezer is running efficiently and frost-free. As with any repair, if it is outside of your comfort zone don’t hesitate to contact your preferred appliance repair technician.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Follow these home remedies to eliminate pest problems from your house and yard.\nFirst, start at the source. Preventative measures are the best way to avoid unwanted pests in your home. Remember to wipe down all your kitchen surfaces. Removing excess food particles and odors will help decrease your pest traffic.\nYou can avoid using harsh chemicals by making your own all-purpose cleaning spray. Combine two tablespoons of liquid peppermint castile soap and one gallon of water. Fill a spray bottle with this mixture, and use it like any store-bought cleaner\nTry transfering food into sealed jars and fix any leaky faucets. Cutting off the food and water supply will make your home less attractive to unwanted guests.\nTo eliminate ant traffic, sprinkle coffee grounds around windows and doors. Spiders can be kept at bay by combining equal parts vinegar and water, then spraying the mixture over the places the spiders are entering. Fight fruit flies with apple cider vinegar! The sweet smell of the vinegar will attract the flies. Place a couple of tablespoons of vinegar in a cup, cover the top with plastic wrap and poke holes in the plastic.\nYou don't need harsh toxins to eliminate unwanted pests. Try these easy DIY remedies to keep your home pest- and chemical-free.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/diy-pest-control/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/59218/pest-hacks.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DIY Pest Control\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON April 28, 2020\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Disinfect Everything in Your Home\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn how to clean and disinfect the surfaces you touch most throughout the...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTips for Keeping Your Home Safe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHome invasions seem to come out of nowhere, but the behavior of burglars is...",

When cleaning electronic devices, or around your home in general, it's essential to always to read the label of any cleaning product before using it, to ensure it will not damage what you are cleaning. Additionally, check your device’s manual or manufacturer resources for any recommendations on cleaning and disinfecting your device. Before cleaning your device, make sure that it’s not plugged in and doesn't have any accessories attached to it, including cases.\n\nCleaning Electronics\n \n \n \nBefore getting into specific cleaning methods, there are a few important things to remember and take precaution around to ensure you do not damage your device. For example, many manufacturers recommend against over-wiping of surfaces as they carry a special coating that can be removed by excessive cleaning and some harsh cleaning agents. Additionally, you should never spray or pour liquid directly on your device, apply the liquid to a clean microfiber cloth and gently rub the device. Lastly, as mentioned in the introduction, do not clean your device with any accessories attached or with the device plugged in.\n\nSoap and water\nSaveEmbed Image\nThe first method we're going use to clean the phone and the case is simply soap and water. This should be your first line of defense in cleaning any surface around your home. Although it's not technically a disinfectant, soap and water do work well at removing all kinds of germs, dirt, and debris. Even if you're going to be disinfecting your phone with disinfecting products as well, using soap and water first is a great way to maximize the disinfecting properties of whatever product you plan on using.\nSaveEmbed Image\nTo use soap and water, first, you'll mix them together in a dish and submerge a microfiber cloth in the soap and water solution and get it nice and moist. and then what you want to do is simply pick up your device and your microfiber cloth and wipe the front screen carefully, ensuring to not get too much moisture around any openings. Make sure you get in and around all the buttons as well, as bacteria collect in those areas. On the back of the device, make sure to properly clean the camera and in any openings around it, but avoid getting soap and water in the openings. Next, move on to the case itself and wipe it with the soap and water solution.\n\nDisinfectants\nSaveEmbed Image\nIf you want a little more peace of mind in terms of disinfecting your phone, a lot of phone manufacturers have said that using disinfecting wipes on your phone is an acceptable way to clean it, again, as long as you're making sure you don't get any solution within the openings of your phone. Take one wipe, sometimes these can be pretty wet with the disinfecting solution, you may need to wring it out once before using it. Pick up your device and give it a proper wipe down all around, making sure to get the buttons but not in any openings. The case should be disinfected as well.\nSaveEmbed Image\nIf you don’t have any disinfecting wipes, you can still use certain household items to disinfect your phone properly. If you have a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe around your home, you can use that just like you would’ve used a disinfecting wipe.\nSaveEmbed Image\nBut let's say you have no disinfecting wipes and, again, soap and water aren’t going to cut it. If you do have bottled isopropyl alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, you can use that to clean your phone as well! Now, you don't want to actually pour it onto your device, but you can take a clean microfiber cloth, dampen it with the hydrogen peroxide or isopropyl alcohol, and clean it the same way as described with soap and water, ensuring not to get moisture trapped in the openings. To take extra precaution around moisture, use a slightly damp cotton swab to clean sensitive areas. \n\nCleaning Household Surfaces\n \n \n\nWhen we talk about cleaning household surfaces, we're mostly referring to commonly touched surfaces that are most likely to spread bacteria. Including doorknobs, table surfaces, dining chairs, kitchen counters, bathroom counters, faucets and knobs, toilets, light switches, TV remote controls, and game controllers. \nSoap and water\nSaveEmbed Image\nLike electronics, this is the most important and often overlooked step of disinfecting surfaces. You should be cleaning many household surfaces, such as counters, with soap and water every single day. Again, it is not a disinfectant so if you want a bit more, you can use equal parts of vinegar and water to kill some types of germs and break down dirt. However, vinegar can damage some surfaces, such as natural stone and marble, so be sure to confirm it is safe for your surface before using it. \nCleaning agents\nNow, let's talk about disinfecting surfaces using store-bought products. Regardless of what product you use, if you are cleaning a surface that comes into contact with food, always be sure to clean the surface with water before preparing food on the surface. \nSaveEmbed Image\nThe easiest to use disinfectants typically come in the form of wipes, which are as simple to use as wiping the surface down lightly and disposing of it in the trash- do not flush disinfectant wipes!\nSaveEmbed Image\nThe next easiest solution is disinfectants that come in spray bottles. They are super easy to use and can act as either general cleaners or be used to disinfect. When you use these products, most people tend to spray it on and instantly wipe it off. However, many of these products need to be left for 10 minutes to kill 99.9% of the bacteria, so be sure to always read the product instructions before beginning. \nSaveEmbed Image\nIf you don’t have any of these supplies, there are a few DIY options available to you. Like electronics, you can use hydrogen peroxide (3-6%, or diluted if higher %) or isopropyl alcohol.  But just like vinegar, these can break down the finishes on some surfaces, so take that into consideration before using them. If you use these products on eating surfaces be sure to clean them with water afterward, as these can be toxic when ingested. \n\nGet cleaning!\nWe hope that this disinfecting guide helps you clean all the surfaces you touch the most, and help slow the spread of germs and bacteria!

A very unfortunate situation for sure. What do you do? Well, there are a few key parts you should check. Let us help you! \n\n For a quick, simple guide, please take a look at our video here. Or view our full text guide below.\n \n \n \n\nSurface Burner Element\nSurface burners are typically either a coil type, solid type or a ribbon coil as used in smooth top ranges. All of these consist of a heating wire that uses electric current to produce heat. Coil type elements can be checked for continuity by removing them from the terminal block and testing them with a multimeter.\nHow to test a surface burner element with a multimeter:\n\nEnsure that you have disconnected the power source from your appliance before beginning.\nLift the main top of your appliance in order to locate the surface burner element. Once you have found it, remove it in order to test it. You should also visually inspect it for any signs of bubbling, burning, wear, holes, or damage.\nTo test for a shorted element, touch each of the terminals one at a time with one probe while holding the other probe to the outside surface of the element. If either terminal show continuity, it is defective. To test the entire element for continuity, place each of the probes on the terminals, one on each. The exact reading you should receive varies between models, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what yours should be, but if any element has a reading outside of 19 to 115 ohms, it is defective.\nIf you do not receive the correct readings from the tests above or find damage on your element, you will need a replacement surface burner element.\n\n\nSurface Burner Terminal Block & Receptacle\nThe burner receptacle or terminal block is used to connect coil elements to the internal wiring. The receptacle is located underneath the cooktop and is mounted to it by one or two screws. If the elements are not heating up, then the receptacles may be faulty.\nHow to test an oven’s surface burner terminal block & receptacle with a multimeter:\n\nUnplug your oven before beginning this inspection.\nLocate and remove your receptacle in order to inspect it. You likely will need to remove the cooktop and the heating elements in order to access the receptacle.\nVisually inspect the terminal block for any signs of damage, cracking, or burning.\nUsing a multimeter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to the terminals. If your receptacle has multiple sets of terminals, test each set individually. If there is continuity, your multimeter will produce a reading of zero.\nIf you receive any reading other than zero, you will need a replacement receptacle.\n\n\nSurface Burner Switch & Infinite Switch\nThe infinite switch on the control panel controls the power to each element. If you have no heat at an element and the element and terminal block check ok, then you may have a defective infinite switch.\nHow to test an oven infinite switch with a multimeter:\n\nUnplug your appliance before beginning.\nLocate your appliance’s infinite switch. You likely will need to remove the back panel in order to access it. Inspect the wires near the switch for any signs of burning, or overheated wires and terminals. If no issues are found, remove the switch in order to test it for continuity.\nUsing a multimeter on Rx1 mode, test for continuity by touching the L1 and H1 terminals with the probes. Once you have completed that test, touch the probes to the L2 & H2 terminals.\nIf your test results indicate that there is no continuity between one or both sets of terminals, you need a replacement infinite switch.\n\n\n By following these tips, you should be able to fix your oven / range completely on your own. Just make sure to have all the oven parts you need. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

A well-maintained lawn requires lots of care, not just for the lawn itself but also your mower.\n\nTo get the most out of your machine it is important that you take such basic measures as brushing your mower with a broom after each use, removing caked grass with a gloved hand (after the mower has come to a complete stop), and once or twice a year, thoroughly cleaning the machine.\n\nGetting \"under the hood\" and paying attention to your mower as you would any engine-powered machine is important. Clean or replace the air filter once or twice a year, replace the spark plug, keep the blade sharp, and empty the fuel tank at the end of the season by allowing the motor to run until the gas runs out.\n\nFollow these basic lawnmower operation tips to take your yard from looking good to looking great! You'll also get better efficiency out of your mower, and that means financial savings! By following these and other maintenance and operation tips, your mower will run in tip-top shape for years to come.

What happened? Well if your dishwasher is stopping mid-cycle there are a few common reasons why this may be occurring.\n  \n  For a full visual guide, please see the following video or read our written guide below.\n \n \n \n\nReason One: Door Latch Assembly\n This is the most common cause of a dishwasher stopping mid-cycle. The Door Latch Assembly  is used to hold the door closed during the cycle to keep water from leaking, and it contains one or two switches that supply power to the controls. If the latch assembly is broken or damaged it won’t keep the door closed, and therefore your system will shut down. \n\nReason Two: Door Catch\nThe catch is a part of your dishwasher frame which connects to the Door Latch Assembly. If this is broken the same problem will occur. Namely that the door won’t stay closed and the machine will shut down. To check the catch, you can simply look at it, and ensure that it is firmly attached to the tub. Some models have adjustable \"mounting screws\". Check your owners manual to find out if you have this kind of model, and how to access the mounting screws. If you have this kind of model, adjust the screws until the door is held securely. If the part appears broken, replace it.\n\nReason Three: Control Board\nIf your assembly and door catch are working properly then it’s possible that the internal electronic components of the washer to fail and prevent your dishwasher from changing cycles. In this case, it will likely need to be replaced. Contact your manufacturer for details on how to replace or repair this issue.\n\n\n  Take a look at these common problem areas to see what may be going wrong with your washer.

Well, then it is time to give it a quick cleaning, to get your machine and clothes smelling nice and fresh.\n\nFor this task you can either view our video guide or read our written guide below:\n\n \n \n \n\nHere’s what you’ll need:\n\nRegular Household Cleaner\nScrubbing Brush or Sponge\nBaking Soda\nVinegar\n\n\nHow to Clean the Dispenser\nA smelly washer may be caused by a build-up of detergent or fabric softener residue. To clean this gunk out of your dispenser, pull it to its fully open position, and press down on the release tab. Then you can remove the dispenser altogether. The easiest way to clean it is to soak it in hot water. Then spray it down with a household cleaner, allow it to set, and then scrub it with a brush to remove all the residue. Now it can be put back into the machine, good as new.\n\nHow to Clean the Tub\nTo clean your tub, take two cups of baking soda and put it into your dispenser or directly into the tub. Select the hottest wash cycle possible (if your model has a clean cycle, then set it to this) and run it to the end. Once that is done, do the same with two cups of vinegar. After this, run the cycle one more time with nothing in the tub to rinse out the baking soda and vinegar. All done!\n\nHow to Clean the Door Bellows\nThe Door Bellows will typically collect dirt or residue in the bottom portion over time.  You can clean this part using a simple household cleaner or you can use a combination of vinegar and baking soda. Make sure to rinse it out afterward. At this time you should also make sure the door glass is clean, particularly down on the bottom edge where residue can collect. Use a household cleaner and sponge to scrub away any built-up gunk.\n\nMaintenance Tips\nTo keep your washer smelling fresh and clean we recommend that at the end of each wash cycle you wipe out the door seal area. Make sure it’s clean and dry. Pull the dispenser drawer out and rinse out any compartment that may have some residue left. Leave the compartment partially open to allow it to dry. Also leave the main door open partway open to allow air to circulate, keeping the drum dry and preventing odors from reoccurring.\n\nNow your clothes will come out smelling better than ever! Alongside these maintenance tips, it’s also important to make sure your washer is in good working condition.

If your igniter is glowing but there is no flame, then one of two components in your range are at fault. These components are the “safety valve” and the igniter itself.\n\nWe’ve put together this video guide to help you learn how to test these two components, as well as a written guide below:\n\n \n \n \n\nIgniter/Safety Valve Circuit Test\n\nTake a clamp-on type ammeter, and attach it to the circuit to determine whether the igniter is working efficiently enough to open the safety valve. Clamp your meter onto the wire that either goes to the bake burner igniter or the bake burner safety valve. Turn on the bake function, and see what current is drawn. Typically your meter will show 2.8 – 3.0 amps for a normal current draw for a working igniter. If your meter is showing 2.7 or lower then you can assume that the igniter is not drawing enough current to actually ignite the flame, and therefore it won’t open the oven safety valve to allow the gas to enter the burner chamber. If this happens, it’s time to replace the oven burner igniter.\n\nThe Oven Igniter\n\nFor a “hot surface” or “glow bar igniter” you can test their power continuity using a multimeter. Simply insert both leads onto the terminals for the igniter and measure the resistance. If it shows resistance, it has continuity. No resistance? No continuity. Typically these will be somewhere between 80 and 175 ohms of resistance for a working igniter.\n\nThe Oven Safety Valve\n\nTo test the oven safety valve, measure between the two terminals, on the valve and look for continuity. The resistance here is low, but you should be able to detect 1 to 1.5 ohms. If your model uses a dual valve, one for the broil burner and one for the bake burner, then you will have two bi-metals and again you can test them for continuity using a multimeter. They also should be very low resistance and those would indicate that they're normal working oven safety valves.\n\nIf after performing these tests, you've determined that you need to replace your gas range's oven safety valves, oven igniter, burn igniter, or safety valves? Take a look at our large selection of oven parts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

What tools are the most essential for starting out? We put together our list of the top 5 tools we would recommend to any DIYer in the following video, as well as the written guide below:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n Power Drill \nSaveEmbed Image\nA drill might be the most essential tool in any tool shed. Even if you aren’t going to be doing any cutting or building, a drill has many basic applications from changing doorknobs to hanging a picture! A power drill can use a screwdriver tip to turn screws or a drill bit to make holes in metal, plastic, or wood.\n\n\n Sander \nSaveEmbed Image\nThe sander is essential to finishing up many jobs. Whether it's trim work or refinishing your furniture, a good sander is what is going to take it to the next level and give that beautiful smooth texture. There are many different types of sanders, each with their own purpose, including belt, palm, and orbital. The palm sander is most versatile of these options and the one we recommend to DIYers only looking to purchase one style of sander.\n\n Miter Saw \nSaveEmbed Image\nA miter saw is a very versatile piece of equipment. It can assist in doing trim work and building pieces of furniture. Also known as a drop or chop saw, a miter saw is used to make accurate cuts at the angle you select. Before using your miter saw, make sure your saw cuts perfectly straight by inspecting the blade and cutting a test piece of material.\n\n Circular Saw \nSaveEmbed Image\nA circular saw is a little less accurate than a miter saw, but it is very portable. This portability makes the circular saw more versatile, and a great purchase for any beginner DIYer. When selecting a circular saw to purchase, ensure that you take note of the side of the blade that the motor sits as circular saws can be either right or left-handed.\n\n Jigsaw \nSaveEmbed Image\nThe jigsaw is the perfect tool for cutting along weird curves, in a way which the circular saw and miter saw cannot. This makes it a great tool for doing flooring. Although it’s not as versatile as the other saws, it is still very important to have for any home installations. Jigsaws are best used for materials between 3/4\" and 1-1/2\" in thickness and have interchangeable blades depending on the material you are cutting.\n\nDo your tools need a little bit of repair?

Whether it's re-heating leftovers or heating up water for tea, the microwave is a versatile and powerful appliance, especially for people who are short on time. But it's not just for warming up prepared food anymore; a microwave can be used in all sorts of ways you would never expect. These \"microwave hacks\" are useful and convenient ways to speed up your kitchen tasks.\n\nUsing a microwave to prep ingredients can save time and help you make the most out of your food. For example, when juicing a citrus fruit, try putting it in the microwave for 20 seconds to soften it up a bit. This will yield you the most juice, without having to strain your muscles! Or, microwave garlic or tomatoes before cooking to make them easier to peel.\n\nYour renewed zest for microwaving foods may come at a steep price: a big mess in your microwave. Fortunately, we have a quick hack for that as well. Simply place a bowl of water with two squeezed-out lemon halves (and their juice) in the microwave and set for five minutes.

If you notice dishes coming out unusually under or overcooked, it may be a good time to do some maintenance! Even if you aren't having any problems it's a good idea to double-check every few months just to be sure.\n\n You can view our video guide on this subject, or read our full text guide below:\n \n \n \n\nThe first thing you'll need for this task is an oven thermometer. These may be sold by your local hardware store, but you're going to want to do some looking around for a high-quality model to get the most accurate temperature reading.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTo check the temperature of your oven, set it to 350 degrees, allow it to pre-heat and then place an oven thermometer in the oven. Wait until the thermometer settles on a number, that is the true temperature of your oven. If it is exactly 350 degrees then congratulations! Your oven is correctly calibrated. Otherwise, make note of the current difference in temperature, and move on to the calibration stage. \n\nElectronic Ranges:\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOn your electronic display, there should be a button that allows you to view the Offset Clock. Check your oven's manual if you aren’t sure. Press this button.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nAdjust the clock so it properly offsets the difference in the temperature you noted earlier. Once you’ve selected that, lock it in according to your oven's instructions, and it will be incorporated into your oven's temperature reading. That's it! You're good to go.\n\nManual Ranges:\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOn manual ranges, there is a temperature sensing bulb that is located inside of the oven, typically close to the sidewall. \n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nBefore we make any adjustments with the manual style thermometer, we want to ensure that the temperature sensing bulb is seated firmly in the mounting brackets attached to the side of the oven wall. That there is no damage to that capillary tube that extends out through the back of the wall and also, and that there are no kinks. If this out of position, damaged or sitting flush against the wall of the oven, it won't sense the temperature accurately. So make sure that it is in good shape before you attempt any adjustments.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nManual ranges will typically have a knob which displays the temperature the oven is supposed to be set to. Pull off the knob, and you may see some screws that will allow you to adjust the knob in relation to the temperature setting.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf you have this kind of dial, you can adjust the temperature using a specialized thin flat blade screwdriver which will fit inside of the knob shaft.  If it feels too tight, find a smaller model.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOnce the screwdriver is inserted you can turn it to adjust the offset (with clockwise typically setting the temperature higher), until the temperature on the dial matches what is inside the oven. If your oven does not fit the typical design described here, please consult your owner's manual for information on how to adjust the oven's temperature offset.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOnce you’ve set that, you can replace the knob and your controls are now set!\n\n\nThat's all there is to it! Now you can cook with full confidence that what is displayed on your oven range, is what is inside in the oven. Happy baking!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

There are a few parts in your microwave that could be damaged, resulting in an exhaust fan that doesn't work. To help you quickly diagnose your issue, we put together this guide with four common parts that may be malfunctioning and causing your exhaust fan to not work:\n\n \n \n\n\nFilters\nA dirty or clogged filter can cause several issues with your microwave, including an exhaust fan that won’t work. Whether you're using the standard grease-type filter or charcoal filter, you should be routinely inspecting them to ensure that they're clean and not damaged.\nWith the grease filter, you can remove it from the microwave and wash it in warm soapy water, allowing it to dry completely before reinstalling it.\nFor charcoal filters, you'll need to replace them if they are dirty or damaged. This style of filter cannot be cleaned and are designed to be replaced once they are dirty.\nShop Replacement Microwave Filters >.\n\nDamper\nIf your over-the-range microwave is vented to the outside and the exhaust fan is not functioning properly, you may have a problem with the damper. The damper is located where the microwave meets the outside venting system.\nTo inspect it, you'll need to drop the microwave from its mounting position and visually inspect it. You are looking for signs of damage, warping, or a broken spring on that damper assembly. If it's unable to be repaired, you will need to replace it.\n Shop Replacement Microwave Dampers >\n\nMotor and Control Board\nIf your exhaust fan is not working at all, you'll need to inspect it to determine whether it's the motor or the controls that is causing the issue. To inspect the motor, you will need to remove the microwave from its mounting.\nFirst, verify that the motor fan will turn freely. If not, you can assume that it is defective and will need to be replaced.\n Shop Replacement Microwave Motors\n\nIf the fan blade does move freely, you'll need to check for voltage. This is a live voltage test, if you have not performed a live voltage test before, we suggest having a professional inspect your microwave. If the test shows there is no voltage present at that motor, you'll need to inspect the control board to determine if there is a loose/faulty connection, or if the board is defective and needs to be replaced.\nShop Replacement Microwave Control Boards\n\nHappy Fixing\nWe hope that this guide helped you find the issue with your microwave!

Well in most cases the answer is simple: an unbalanced washer. An improperly loaded washer will cause the machine to become unbalanced and rock back and forth. It's an unpleasant sound for sure, but did you know it can also damage your washer over time?\n\nTo show the effects of an unbalanced washer, we conducted a stress test using bowling balls. You can view this and a simple explanation of how this problem occurs by watching our video or you can follow the written guide below:\n\n \n \n \n\nTo properly balance a washer, try to sort out your fabrics into different weights beforehand. This will also be useful in ensuring that each type of fabric receives proper treatment. Try making three piles: light, medium and heavy. Light will include your undergarments and thin fabric clothes, the medium pile includes most typical daily wear such as t-shirts and pants, and the heavy pile will include towels and thick sweaters.\n\nIf your washer is top-loaded, make sure that the various items are evenly distributed around the agitator. Too much weight on one side or the other will make your washer unbalanced. With items like towels remember they will absorb a lot of water and become much heavier than when you put them in.\n\nWhen your washer is properly balanced the cycle should sound smooth with very minimal shaking. An imbalanced wash will shake, sometimes violently. Over time the violent shaking can cause damage to the washer itself, eventually leading to a breakdown. Too much stress on the shock-absorbing parts such as the suspension springs, damper pads and tub dampening straps can cause them to break, bend or snap. \n\nIf you're certain your washer is loaded properly and it still shakes then try taking out or adding clothes, changing cycles, or if all else fails: consult with the manufacturer of the machine as it is likely damaged.\n\nIf your machine appears to be broken, don't worry we've got you covered.

Our health is one of the most important things we have so of course, when thinking about our ideal future, good health will be a key goal. For many people, this involves hitting the gym again or starting an at-home workout routine. This is a great idea but many people don't realize just how difficult it can be to make sure your equipment is clean without damaging the material or exposing yourself to dangerous chemicals. The frequent touching, movement, and moisture exercise equipment endures means its a hotbed for potential bacteria.\n\nSome of the bacteria that can live on your gym equipment include rhinoviruses, klebsiella, and streptococcal bacteria. These can hide on your weights, mats, and equipment such as treadmills and ellipticals.\n\nIn order to eradicate these pesky little bacteria effectively, most people will turn to harsh cleaning chemicals, but this isn't necessary. You can use a natural spray cleaning solution to remove most bacteria by spraying it onto the surface and letting it sit for between 10-30 minutes before wiping off. If you use harsh chemical cleaners that would require gloves, the cleaning solution may linger and you will come in contact with it again through normal use of your equipment. Over time this can damage skin, cause an allergic reaction, or break down the material in the equipment you are using.\n\nHowever, for many people even store-bought natural sprays can be too much.

Clean and Deodorize Garbage Disposal8. Clean Dryer Exhaust9. Inspect Washing Maching Hoses10. Clean Your Air Conditioner FilterWrap-upMany people think of cleaning as a chore, but periodic maintenance of your household appliances can potentially save you from a list of repairs. Regular upkeep, such as replacing worn appliance parts, will improve the appliance's efficiency while also keeping more money in your wallet. Take 10 minutes out of your schedule to try one of these 10 quick and easy maintenance tips:\n\n1. Verify Oven Door Has Tight Seal\n \n \n \nOver 20% of your oven's heat can escape if the door is not sealed properly, meaning your oven could using 20% more energy than necessary, increasing your energy bills. To inspect your oven door seal, open the oven door and locate the rubber gasket around the perimeter of the door and feel for any broken, torn, or deformed areas on your seal. Next, close the door, turn on the oven, and see if you can find any leaks by feeling around the perimeter with your hand.\nIf you find any issues, you will need a Replacement Oven Door Seal.\n\n2. Clean or Replace Dirty Vent Filters\n \n \n \nAnother simple inspection that can increase your appliances' performance is checking vent filters. A dirty or clogged filter causes your appliances to work harder than necessary, resulting in more energy being used and costing you money! \nMetal-mesh grease filters can be washed by hand in soapy water or you can put them in your dishwasher for a thorough cleaning.\nDon't attempt to wash charcoal or paper filters; they are single-use filters and need to be replaced.\nShop Replacement Vent Filters >\n\n\n3. Clean Stovetop Drip Bowls\n \n \n \nDrip bowls are designed to catch any spills that would otherwise splash into your range, potentially ruining your appliance. But if you do not reguarlily clean these bowls, they become a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and cause you to get sick.\nTo clean them, remove the drip bowls from underneath your burner elements and pre-soak the drip bowls in a cleaning solution for 5 minutes. Then wash, clean, and place them back under the burners\nRemember to clean drip bowls immediately after spills. If spills burn into the bowls you may need Replacement Drip Bowls.\n\n4. Clean Coils in Your Refrigerator\n \n \n \nIn the video above, Steve shows you how to clean fan-cooled \"jelly roll\" condensor coils. However, there are 3 different types of condensor coils, all with their own cleaning methods. But don't worry, we have videos showing you how to clean the other 2 styles as well!\nHow to clean static condensor coilsHow to clean fan-cooled open coils\n\n5. Change Refrigerator Water Filter\n \n \n \nFilters that don't efficiently remove contaminants and impurities may expose you to harmful water. Which is why it is very important that you reguarily check and replace your water filters\nTo replace your filter, follow the instructions found on the filter itself or in your owner's manual, as exact replacement methods vary from model to model. However, most are as easy as turning the filter one-quarter inch and popping it out (or locking it in place when installing).\nIf you need a replacement filter, we've got you covered with filters for hundreds of models. Shop Replacement Water Filters >. If you aren't sure what filter you need, try our Water Filter Finder!\n\n6. Fix Rusty Dishrack Tines\n \n \n \nIf the tines are rusty, the rust can adhere to and ruin your dishes and silverware! When this happens, many homeowners will replace the entire dishrack, or even the entire dishwasher! However, these tines can be easily repaired with a Tine Repair Kit! Use a sealant to adhere the replacement tips over any damaged, rusty, or chipped tines, and let dry for at least 24 hours before running your dishwasher\n\n7. Clean and Deodorize Garbage Disposal\nAfter making sure the unit has been turned off, look down the drain for any large, stuck items. If you see anything, use tongs or another tool to fish items out, don't stick your hands in the disposal. Next, prepare a mixture of ice cubes and salt (or vinegar), pour it down the drain, run cold water over it for 10 seconds, and then turn the unit on. Finally to deodorize, simply place a handful of citrus peels in the disposal, run cold water and turn it on.\nIf this doesn't solve the smell issue, it's possible that you have a part that is malfunctioning and needs to be replaced. To learn how to determine if you have a broken part causing the smell, view our repair center article >.\n\n8. Clean Dryer Exhaust\n \n \n \nBuilt up lint in your dryer exhaust is a serious fire hazard, but yet many homeowners rarely, if ever, clean their dryer exhaust. \nTo clean your dryer exhaust, loosen the clamp holding the hose on and pull the exhaust off the back of the dryer. Remove clumps of lint from the tubing and the hole in the back of the dryer. Then, use a coat hanger to carefully remove any large clumps that you can't reach with your hands. Once you have removed the large pieces, use your vaccuum to collect all the small lint.\n\n9. Inspect Washing Maching Hoses\n \n \n \nMost washing machine floods are caused by leaks in the hose and can be easily prevented by regularily inspecting your hoses for damage, wear, and cracking.\nInspecting your washing machine hoses is very easy. Simply remove the panel on your washing machine, locate the hoses, and search for any cracks, leaks or weak spots on your hoses. If you find any, you will need Replacement Washing Machine Hoses.\n\n10. Clean Your Air Conditioner Filter\nA dirty or clogged filter in an air conditioner can result in your air conditioner not being able to blow cold air at maximum efficiency, or at all due to restricted airflow.  If the air filter is dirty, the restricted airflow can cause a buildup of frost or ice on the coils, which can lead to other problems. \nWhile the exact removal and cleaning method will vary from model to model, for most window units you can locate the air filter behind the front grille. Once you have removed it, clean the filter, or replace it if it is too dirty or damaged to function. Take this opportunity to also clean the fan blades and evaporator coils with soap, water, and a soft brush.\nShop Replacement Air Conditioner Filters >\n\nWrap-up\nTo keep your home operating at maximum efficiency, and to keep more money in your pocket, make sure to regularly perform each of the easy tasks described above!

It's important to care for your stovetop to keep it looking nice and smooth, and without scratches. These tops are tough but not indestructible. To see just how much they can take, we put our ceramic top to the test with this smash test:\n\n \n \n \n\nNow, this is extreme, of course. You're unlikely to completely shatter your ceramic top, but it is possible to crack it by dropping a large pot or heavy object, or by attempting to chop ingredients directly on the stovetop. If you crack your ceramic DO NOT USE IT. Cracked ceramic can cause electrocution if it comes into contact with liquid while turned on. If you crack your ceramic we strongly recommend you replace it with one of the many options we have available: here.\n\nEven though these big cracks are rare, it is very easy for small scratches to build up. To care for your ceramic top we have the following recommendations:\n\n\nLift up your pans and pots instead of dragging them.\nAvoid using abrasive materials when cleaning your stove top. Use cloths or soft sponges rather than scouring pads or attempting to scrape the top.\nMake sure your top, and the bottom of your pans, are both clean before cooking. Any food residue on the top, or on the bottom of your pots and pans, could burn and cause damage.\nBe careful of pans and pots with textured bottoms (such as rings). While you can use these items with your stove, they are riskier because of their abrasive texture and less even heating pattern. So go for a smooth bottom, or if there aren't alternatives, just try to be very careful.\nAvoid putting heavy objects on the stove top. A big pot of soup is ok, but don't attempt to use your stove as temporary counter space or else you may crack it.\nBe VERY careful with sugar and sugary substances like jam or syrups. The sugar, when burned, can fuse to the top permanently. Try to clean it up as quickly as possible (without putting yourself in danger) to avoid a sticky mess.\nOnly use pots and pans that fit the size of the cooktop\n\n\n\nIf you get deep scratches in the top surface, they are likely there to stay. However, for superficial scratches, one popular home remedy is using baking soda.\nHere's how to fix stove top scratches with baking soda:\n\nMix two parts baking soda to one part water to form a paste\nTake a soft sponge or cloth and dampen it\nDip the sponge or cloth in the paste, and apply to scratched areas\nBuff out the paste until the scratches are minimized or erased\nWipe off the paste with another clean damp cloth or sponge, and dry off the area\n\nAnd you're done! Now this is just one of multiple methods. Some other common products to use are:\n\nToothpaste\nMetal Polish\nCeramic Cleaner\n\nIf your stove is in need of repairs, please visit Partselect.com for all your appliance part needs.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Thankfully, planning can help make things run smoothly. You’ve probably already thought about your shopping lists and maybe even tested out your recipes, but have you thought about checking your appliances? Meals are often the most important (and most anticipated!) part of any holiday and if your oven isn’t working properly, you could be in for a big disaster. Here are some tips on what to check on your appliances to make sure they can handle the extra holiday load. \n\n  Oven \n\n Our resident handyman and repair technician Steve says a working oven/range is essential over the holidays. The main event will undoubtedly be the holiday meal and no one wants a malfunctioning range to spoil that. Steve suggests you should: \n\n     Inspect the bake and broil elements for signs of corrosion or arcing. The elements should be smooth and clear of any blemishes. If there is any food spillage on the elements from boilovers, this should be carefully examined as that is the first place that the element would rupture. \n\n     Make sure you know how to work your oven, particularly if it has an electronic clock. You don’t want to accidentally set your oven to a control lockout, for instance, and not be able to cancel those settings. Locate your user guide or find one online to ensure that you don’t end up in a fix. \n\n     To make sure you can cook your side dishes and then keep them warm, test the surface elements to make sure that they function properly. Vary the controls from simmer to high to verify that they cycle accordingly.  \n\n     Even though a clean oven is important, if you have a self-cleaning oven it is recommended to not put the range through a clean cycle. The high heat generated during a clean cycle as well as the increased use of the element can sometimes cause premature failure of a component that is on the borderline but would have otherwise functioned fine during a normal cooking day.  \n\n     Before your main cook day, put the range through a bake cycle for at least 30 minutes or more, to make sure that everything is working okay. This would also be a great time to test your actual oven temperature with a kitchen thermometer. A variation of even 25°F could mean the difference between a perfectly cooked pumpkin pie or burnt charcoal for dessert. \n\n For a visual guide to making sure your oven is ready for the holidays, check out our video here:\n\n \n \n \n\n Fridge \n\n     Take some time and clean out your fridge, throwing out any expired or spoiled foods to make room for the extra storage space holidays often require. \n    \n Check that your fridge is at an optimal temperature; not too warm to spoil foods, but not too cold that it freezes them. A refrigerator’s optimal temperature range is 34-40°F (2-5°C). \n\n     Holidays tend to be particularly exhaustive on fridges so any signs of cracks should be dealt with before breaking and losing precious fridge space for all the festive goodies. \n\n     If required, replace a burnt out light bulb so you can see what you have in there!  \n\n Freezer \n\n     You’ll want to make sure your freezer is freezing items if you intend to store a frozen turkey or ham in there. If your freezer is warm, it could be because of a defective door switch, defrost thermostat, defrost timer or defrost heater. Check each of these and replace it if necessary. \n \n    When hosting for a crowd, you often go through a lot of ice, so check that your ice machine is making ice. If there is an issue, check the water inlet valve and defrost timer as those are likely the source of the issue. \n\n     If you have an older model freezer that is looking pretty icy a few weeks before the holidays, unplug your freezer and defrost it so you can reclaim the extra space. \n\n  Dishwasher\n\n     The last thing you want when you’re finally relaxing after loading the dishwasher is to come back to a set of still-dirty dishes! Make sure you are using enough soap and your rinse aid compartment isn’t empty. \n\n     If your dishwasher is sounding like a monster, do a quick sweep of the drain, as you may have some broken glass lodged in there. If this does not solve the problem, you may need to replace the drain and wash impeller. \n\n     To avoid having to wash the dishes by hand, run a test load to be sure your dishwasher fills with water. If it doesn't, you may need to check the float assembly and float switch. \n\n     Make sure the rack wheels are correctly on the track to make it easier to load and unload the dishwasher. This is also a good time to check the silverware baskets, if they are broken or damaged, it could cause your silverware to fall to the bottom and do some damage. These baskets are inexpensive to replace. \n\n Microwave \n\n     If you have prepped a dish ahead of time or a guest brings an item that needs reheating, you’ll want to make sure your microwave is working and that your turntable is turning. If it isn’t, it may just need to be realigned, which is an easy fix, or you may need a new part for your carousel. \n\n     This is also a good time to clean your microwave to prevent old odors or flavors from permeating your dish. An easy way to clean the microwave is to place a wet sponge in it and heat at full power for two minutes. This will create some steam and the grime will wipe right off with the sponge. \n\n Washing Machine\n\n     If you only use white table linens during the holidays, they may be smelling a bit musty and need refreshing. Soak them in lukewarm water and color-safe bleach for 24 hours, then rinse them with vinegar and water. This may also help get out last year’s unnoticed cranberry sauce stain. \n\n     Even though there are now cold-water detergents, hot water is best for washing white linens. If it’s been a while since you’ve washed with hot water, check to make sure the water is hot. If it’s not, check the water inlet valve, it may be time to replace it. \n\n Following these tips and making sure you’re well prepared for the duty of hosting will save you a lot of trouble, so you can spend more time in the company of your friends and family. Enjoy the Holidays!  \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Power outages are a big risk. A power outage is not only a nuisance but can make some foods in the freezer and refrigerator unsafe to eat. Here are some tips on keeping your food safe during a power outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Food Cold\n\nKeep refrigerator and freezer doors shut while the power is out in order to keep foods cold as long as possible. Typically, if you keep your refrigerator doors closed during a power outage, the food can stay safe for up to four hours, so be sure to keep track of how much time has passed. A helpful trick you can try is to freeze some bottles full of water before the power goes out. This way when the power goes out, the ice will keep your food cold longer. Just be careful not to overfill your bottle or it could bust!\n\nYou can also arrange items or bags of food close together in the freezer so they will stay colder for a longer period. If you have a chest freezer or a standing freezer, those may be more effective than a simple fridge freezer but this will depend on the model. Use your judgment.\n\nAnother way to keep things cold longer is to use a cooler. A large insulated cooler can be packed with ice to use as storage for some perishable foods in the event of a long power outage. Even if you don't have ice ready, you can usually purchase big bags for cheap at your local grocery store or gas station. However, supplies can run out if the weather is getting bad, so try to pick up ice early if possible.\n\nCoolers that are used to store perishable foods should be kept in a cool area. You can even put them outside in the snow if the conditions are right. This way you are making the weather work for you!\n\n Food Safety \nKeep a thermometer on hand that can determine the temperature of foods. If an item of food is over 40 degrees Fahrenheit it may have gone bad. This is considered the \"danger zone\" because it is the point at which bacteria is able to grow. You never want food to be at this temperature for more than two hours, but even twenty minutes can be risky. Make sure to check any food that has gone past this temperature, or has dethawed. Spoiled items of food may have an odd odor or color, but internal temperature is a better indicator. You can also check the appliance thermometer inside the refrigerator to determine the temperature of the unit. \n\nIf you have frozen food that fully dethaws, do not refreeze it. Try to keep the food at a safe level, and cook it as soon as you can. Make sure to prioritize foods that are not safe unless frozen (like meat) over foods that can remain unthawed for a length of time (such as frozen vegetables or fruit). Again be very careful to check the food for spoilage, and try to track how much time it has spent unthawed.\n\nBe extra careful with any meat products. If meat is in the freezer, it can dethaw and cause liquid to spill out, which will contaminate other food. Make sure the meat is fully packed up before the power goes out (or immediately after) to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nIf your phones still work then try calling the electric company to get an estimate on when the power will be restored. An estimated time will help a family to determine whether to ask friends for some freezer space. Cell phones should still be able to access data and check for online updates, as well as the current weather forecast.\n\nSo, while power outages can be a big nuisance, there are ways to make sure your food stays safe so you don't have to throw out anything when it comes back on. Stay safe and be prepared this winter, it's gonna be a cold one!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

I love to wear white during the season, but that can be a BIG risk with all the meals and snacks wherever you go. Whether it's a big turkey dinner, a simple spread of snacks, or just a few glasses of wine, there are so many places to encounter stains. If you have kids this is doubly true. A couple of misplaced candy canes can ruin a good pair of pants unless you act fast. We hope that with this little guide you won't have to throw out any of your favorite party attire, and can keep the good times rolling!\n\nWhen it comes to stains the most important thing is to act fast. It's good to make sure you have some backup clothes you can switch into if you need to quickly throw something in the wash. Stains are much easier to tackle when they are fresh. Waiting even a couple of hours may result in permanent damage. Use liquid detergent with a grease-cutting agent, and never apply heat to fabric until the stain is adequately removed. If the stain is still stuck, don't throw it in the dryer as that can make it even harder to remove, or even seal it in permanently! Of course, as always make sure you know the washing and drying needs of each fabric before you throw them in for a cycle.\n\n Whether it's turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce, eggnog, wine, chocolate or even candle wax there's no need to panic. Just act quickly and follow these simple steps to get your Christmas clothes looking their best!\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/holiday-stain-removal-guide/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/59124/Holiday-Stain-Guide-Infographic.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Holiday Stain Removal Guide\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON December 20, 2019\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaundry Room Cheat Sheets\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProperly washing & drying clothes without damaging or fading them is vital....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSticky Stuff:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTravel light on your next outdoor excursion by packing a roll of duct tape ...",

A dishwasher can be an all-out cleaning machine if you know how to use it right. With a little research and a bit of courage, you can be cleaning everything from toys to hubcaps in your dishwasher. Just make sure you aren't mixing these items in with your regular dishes, unless you're okay with pasta sauce on your baseball cap!\n\nHere are just a few ways you can use your dishwasher as a multi-purpose cleaning machine.\n\nCar hubcaps and wheel covers\n\nHubcaps and wheel covers come squeaky clean when washed in the dishwasher. Use the pots and pans wash cycle for a deep cleaning.\n\nBaseball hats\n\nPlace the hat on the top rack (this will help retain its shape). Use the normal wash cycle to clean the surface of the hat.\n\nKeyboards\n\nPop off the keys and put them in the utensil container. Wrap the USB connector end in plastic to keep it dry. Lay the keyboard face-down on the top rack. Use the normal wash cycle and let the keyboard dry before putting the keys back on. The keyboard will be squeaky clean and germ-free.\n\nChild/pet toys\n\nAny toy made of hard plastic and not battery operated is dishwasher safe. Use the normal wash cycle to rid the toys of dirt and germs.\n\nPlastic flip flops, rubber boots, and even Crocs\n\nAll types of plastic and rubber footwear is dishwasher safe and can be cleaned using the pots and pans wash cycle. Adding baking soda to the detergent dispenser will boost the cleaning power of your dishwasher.\n\nSporting equipment\n\nHockey pads, kneepads and shin guards can be cleaned and sterilized in the dishwasher. Use the normal wash cycle, but do not use detergent or the dry cycle.\n\nPlastic, metal and glass wall shelving, refrigerator shelving, and storage bins\n\nAll are dishwasher safe and can be cleaned using the normal wash cycle.\n\nHand tools and garden tools\n\nProviding that there is no rust or too much dirt buildup on the tools, they can be washed using the normal wash cycle. Prevent surface rust buildup by drying the tools when the wash cycle is complete.\n\nBroom head and dustpan\n\nAll plastic types are dishwasher safe and will be revived after being washed on the normal cycle.\n\nHousehold fans\n\nRemove the face-plate/grill from the fan and lay it on the bottom shelf. Use the normal wash cycle. Dry off the faceplate/grill when the cycle is complete and the fan will be clean and dust-free.\n\n\t\n\nItems That Surprisingly May Not Go in The Dishwasher\n\nSo, obviously your dishwasher is a lot more powerful than you'd expect, which is great, but also means you need to be careful. Some items may seem dishwasher safe, but require a little extra caution.\n\n\nTravel Mugs and Flasks\n\nWhile it may seem safe to throw your new Yeti, Hydroflask, or Nalgean bottle in with the dishes, you should be careful and check the manufacturer guidelines, and check the bottom of the bottle for any \"dishwasher safe\" indicators. When in doubt, hand-wash.\n\nHydroflasks are not dishwasher safe, while Yetis and Nalgenes are typically dishwasher safe, although you should still check the manufacturer's information, as not all models will be the same.\n\nTupperware and Plastic Containers\nAlthough your Tupperware may seem sturdy, it is fairly weak to heat. They are considered \"top-level safe\", meaning you can put them at the top of your dishwasher, but if they come too close to the heating elements they can warp. Hand-washing is the best method if you have the time for it. If you are using another brand of plastic container, you can check the manufacturer's instructions and check the container for any \"dishwasher safe\" indicator.\n\n\nWow! Who knew a dishwasher could accomplish so much? If you try any of these innovative methods, just make sure to be careful, do your research, don't mix and match dishes with household items, and make sure your dishwasher is nice and clean before you go back to regular dish-washing. These are powerful machines and can do so much, but that also means you need to be careful with whatever you put in there. Make sure even with typical containers and culinary items to double check that they are dishwasher-safe, so you don't cover your fine china in melted plastic.\n\nHappy Dishwashing!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Diagnosing and solving this issue yourself can save you time, money, and stress that can come from hiring an expensive repair tech. To make it easier for you, we put together a guide covering the 6 most common noises made by dishwashers, as well as how to fix each type of noise: \n\n \n \n\n\nGrinding Sounds\nIf you're hearing grinding, something may be stuck in the chopper blade area of the dishwasher. To inspect the chopper, remove the cover on the bottom of the inside of the dishwasher. Be sure to clean both the chopper area as well as the manual filter.  \nShop Replacement Dishwasher Choppers >Save\n\nThumping Sounds\nGenerally, these are nothing to be overly concerned about as they're simple and easy to fix! First, open your dishwasher and be sure that no items are hanging down below either rack. If they are, it's likely that the rotating spray arm is contacting them and causing the thumping sound.\nIf no dishes are contacting the spray arm, your next step should be to check the drain hose as it may be thumping against the cabinet as it drains. To fix this issue, simply pull the dishwasher out to reposition the hose so it doesn't come into contact with any other surfaces, and the sound should disappear! \nShop Replacement Dishwasher Drain Hoses >Save\n\n\nLoud Buzzing Sounds\nThe most likely cause of loud buzzing noises is an obstructed/dirty drain or wash pump. Refer to your owner’s manual for the exact locations and removal methods, but they most likely located on the back of the dishwasher, near the top. Inspect both the washer to ensure nothing is obstructing the areas and they are clean from debris. If there are no obstructions, it may be necessary to replace them.\nShop Replacement Dishwasher Pumps >Save\n\n\nSquealing or Continuous Droning Sounds\nAgain, the most likely culprit is the wash or drain pump. The motor will begin to make a squealing or\ndroning sound when its bearings have gone bad. If this is the issue with your dishwasher, you'll need to replace the wash pump entirely. If you need help replacing yours, watch the instructional video below!\nShop Replacement Dishwasher Pumps > \n \n\n\n\nScraping Sounds\nThis is likely caused by a damaged impeller or impeller fin scraping against the pump housing. Depending on the model of your dishwasher, you may be able to simply replace the impeller itself, rather than the entire motor. To inspect this issue, you will need to remove the pump housing, which is usually accessed by pulling the dishwasher out and removing the bottom panel. Once you have removed the pump housing, inspect to see if the impeller is damaged and able to spin freely with minimal resistance. \nShop Replacement Dishwasher Impellers >Save\n\n\nBeeping Sounds\nIf your dishwasher is beeping every few seconds, it's likely because the door is not properly closed during its cycle. Ensure the door is latched properly to eliminate the beeping sound. If your dishwasher door will not latch properly, it may be time to replace the latch. Watch the instructional video below to learn how to inspect and replace yours!\nShop Replacement Dishwasher Pumps > \n \n\n\n\nWrap-Up\nThere you have it, 6 of the most common dishwasher sounds explained!

Whether they come from family or from the internet, it's easy to pick up beliefs that may not be totally accurate, and the kitchen is no exception. So which myths are true, and which are false? Well, we've collected some of the most common myths we've encountered and researched whether or not they are true.  \n\nTo find out which myths are true and which are false, check out the video we've prepared or our written explanation below.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nMYTH 1\nMicrowaves emit radiation that can harm you: FALSE\nThis is easily the most popular of all the appliance myths. After all, microwaves can seem a little bit strange if you don't know how they work. It's easy to worry that the radiation inside your microwave may be affecting things outside of it. Fortunately, this is only a myth.\nMicrowaves do use radiation to cook, but only affect objects which come into direct contact. Microwave radiation is very specific, which is why food can sometimes come out unevenly cooked. To be affected by this radiation, you would need to be inside the microwave yourself!\nSince most of us have enough sense not to climb inside the microwave, there's no need to fear. The only way microwave radiation can escape is if there is a leak in the door seal. Knowing this, you need to keep your microwave properly maintained and never try to repair it yourself.\n\nMYTH 2\nDishwashers completely fill with water when operating: FALSE\nRepair technicians should be familiar with this myth, as many homeowners express concern about opening their dishwasher during the wash cycle for fear that gallons of water will pour out like a waterfall onto their kitchen floor.\nWhile this myth does actually sound quite plausible, again, it's totally false. Only the bottom of the dishwasher tub (below the level of the door) fills with water. A pump-driven impeller, located in the bottom of the dishwasher tub, pushes water through tiny jet-holes located in spray arms that rotate during the wash and rinse cycles, spraying water on everything inside the dishwasher.\nSo, the next time you need to open your dishwasher mid-cycle, don't hesitate! The most you'll get is a bit of steam in your face.\n\nMYTH 3\nDishes need to be \"pre-rinsed\" before being washed in a dishwasher: FALSE\nMany people swear by the \"pre-rinse\" method, but we are happy to report it's not necessary. Your dishwasher should be able to handle the whole job by itself.\nWhat may surprise consumers is that pre-rinsing can actually harm your dishes because the concentration of alkaline in the dishwasher detergent becomes higher than normal. After all, detergent is made to clean stuck-on grease and grime, so without bits of food to attack, the alkaline level can start to damage your dishes, leaving them cloudy, or scratched. Let's be realistic though, don't leave a half-eaten sandwich on your plate and put in the dishwasher.\n\nMYTH 4\nAppliances don't use power while in stand-by mode: FALSE\nMany people assume an appliance in stand-by mode doesn't consume any power. However, stand-by modes still require some energy in order to keep the appliance partially powered on. Almost all home appliances and electronics continue to consume power when in \"stand-by\".\nCheck out these stand-by power consumption rates:\n\n  Microwave oven: up to 6 watts per hour\n  Ranges: up to 4.1 watts per hour\n  Telephone: up to 5 watts per hour\n\nIn some cases, appliances in stand-by mode can consume as much as 15-30 watts per hour; that's a lot of power usage day after day, week after week.\nYou can reduce or eliminate excess power consumption, do your part to save the environment, and save yourself some money by simply powering down your appliances completely or unplugging them when they're not in use.\n\nMYTH 5\nWashing dishes by hand uses less water than a dishwasher: FALSE\nMany homeowners believe they're helping the environment and reducing their water bill by washing dishes the old-fashioned way rather than using a dishwasher. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nModern dishwashers use, on average, 1-1.5 kilowatt-hours of energy and 3.7 gallons of water (an amount equal to one full kitchen sink). Take into consideration how many full sinks you use to wash a pile of dishes and the amount of water you use for rinsing the dishes and it's easy to see how wrong this myth is. Washing by hand consumes much more water than using your dishwasher, especially when you consider that washing dishes by hand is a daily affair whereas you may only run your dishwasher every 2 or 3 days. So if water consumption is a concern, just let your dishwasher take care of it\n\n\nMany myths can make our lives more complicated, as we take unnecessary steps to solve problems that may not be totally real. Just use your appliances properly and you have nothing to worry about. If you have a concern about one or more of your appliances, do your research and read your appliance manuals. It's always a good idea to double-check your assumed beliefs.\n\nDo your appliances need a little tune-up?

In fact, many more complex and esoteric craft beer styles work beautifully with barbecued meats and their accompanying sides.\n\nBarbecues are often about simple ingredients prepared simply. Burgers and steaks thrown on a hot grill. \nBig slabs of chicken, beef, or pork set above a fire and left to cook. \nThese entrees are often seasoned with nothing more than salt, pepper, and maybe, eventually, a little sauce. \nThese bold, basic flavors make pairing beers easy, with ample flexibility for everybody’s tastes. \nBefore looking at pairings, though, we should first consider the flavors that are most prominent in barbecue.\n\nSmoking vs. Grilling\n\nIn many parts of the country, “barbecuing” or “having a barbecue” is a catchall term for simply cooking outside. \nIn the south, though, barbecue is a distinct style of food. \nBasically, it involves any type of meat (though, typically, beef brisket, ribs, \npork shoulder or butt, and chicken) slowly cooked over low (180–300 degrees) and indirect heat. \n“Grilling” is cooking meat (typically burgers, steaks, sausages, or smaller pieces of pork and chicken) over a direct and hot (400 degrees or more) flame. \nThus, if you’re taking ten minutes to make a few burgers, you are not \n“barbecuing,” you are “grilling.” (We won’t get into certain regions that use the term “cookout.”)\n\nThis isn’t just a pedantic point, though. Because barbecuing (also known as “smoking”) and grilling impart radically different flavor profiles and textures, \nthey call for radically different beers to match. Grilled meat often has a nice brown or black crust on the \noutside and will typically need crisper beers to cut through that rich, caramelized profile, while slowly–smoked meat (obviously smoky), \nmay have intense flavors imparted by charcoal or, even better, by any one of a variety of woods \n(apple, hickory, cherry, etc.) employed to create the fire, calling for sweeter, more flavorful beers.\n\nSlow–cooking also leads to meat that is succulent and tender. \nTraditionally larger and lower–quality (fatty) cuts are used and slow–cooking is able to break down remaining tough muscle tissue. \nAfter hours of smoking, these cuts become moist and began to almost fall apart. We’ll need beers that texturally work with these meats.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\t\n\nBurgers and Beer\n\nWhile not technically “barbecue,” if you’re cooking outside, it’s still quite likely some ground meat is being thrown on the grill. Like beer, burgers are so versatile. \nThey can be simple (meat and bun) or complex, adorned with any sort of ingredients and toppings you can imagine. \nThey need not even necessarily be beef, as today we’re seeing “burgers” made out of everything from ground lamb to elk and bison, to even salmon.\n\nNo matter the meat used, however, you’re still going to be looking at a charred, crusted patty packed with fat and saltiness, \ntopped with even more fat and saltiness (and perhaps funkiness) from cheese, with vegetables and pickles for a little clean freshness and acidity, \nand condiments like ketchup for sweetness. Perfect for any number of quality pairings.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\t\n\nSteaks and Beer\n\nLike burgers, steak is not “barbecue” per se. But, again, no backyard cookout would be complete \nwithout a few nice hunks of cow, rarely seasoned with much more than salt and pepper. \nDifferent cuts of steak have different features –sirloins are intensely rich and beefy, \nporterhouse and T–bones are more delicate and lean, while tri–tips, chuck, and round can be flavorful but tough. \nCooking to different doneness is a necessity for getting the most of the various cuts – \nand the rarer the steak the more you’ll probably want to offset the meaty taste with beer.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRibs and Beer\n\nTo many, a slab of “fallin’ off the bone” ribs are the quintessential barbecue dish. While the ribs of many animals are eaten in world cuisine, \nin American BBQ, we are typically talking about a rack of pork ribs, either baby back or spare. \nDepending on the area of the country, these ribs can typically be prepared with merely a dry rub (Memphis) or sauced – \nor sometimes even both (Kansas City). Texas and certain other places opt for dry–rubbed beef ribs.\n\nOften cooked for ten hours or more, baby back ribs are typically leaner and more tender, \nwhile spare ribs are fattier and a lot meatier. All barbecue ribs should be moist and quite \nflavorful, and necessitate beer pairings that can stand up alongside them.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nChicken and Beer\n\nAs opposed to the previous meats, which are typically cooked only one way, \nthe great thing about barbecue chicken is that it can be cooked both ways – \ngrilled or smoked. That means far more possible beer pairings.\n\nOf course, since chicken has a much milder flavor than pork, or certainly beef, we are still going to have to be careful, \nlooking for lighter, simpler beers that won’t completely mask the chicken’s flavor. \nIn many cases, it’s best if you actually try to pair your beer with your chicken’s marinade, rub, or sauce.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nVegetarian Options\n\nWhether or not you identify as a vegetarian, you’re going to want to eat veggies at a barbecue. \nThese could be simple grilled vegetables (like peppers or corn), or any number of notable side dishes (like coleslaw or potato salad). \nWith less aggressive flavors than meat, you should opt for beers that are likewise not as powerful.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nCooking With Beer\n\nOne of the best ways to pair beer with BBQ is to actually just cook with it. \nThis isn’t just delicious – but a lot healthier for you too. (Recent studies have found that marinating meats \nin beer can help kill potential carcinogens that are sometimes created during the smoking/grilling process.)\n\nYou can of course try marinating your meat in the beer you’re currently drinking during prep – \nand the one that you will eventually serve with the meal. In this case, the maltier the better. \nLikewise, you can soak your wood chips in beer, so that it gives \nthe smoke a hint of the beer flavor, while also slowing the combustion rate of the wood.\n\nDuring the smoking process, many barbecuers like to continually baste, spray, or even “mop” their meat with liquid, \nto continue adding flavor. You guessed it – a crisp light beer works splendidly here, as well as apple cider. \nBeer can also be used as a component in a homemade sauce.

The same goes for hotel booking sites.\n\nAs you make your reservations, store them in a custom-built travel itinerary app such as TripIt. \nSuch apps will automatically import confirmation emails and reservation codes to your itinerary, \nand will update travelers in real time if there are changes to flight schedules. \nYou can also share your itinerary with friends and family.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDuring your trip, you’ll need road-ready apps that don’t take a lot of battery power to run and, \nideally, don’t require a WiFi connection to do their job. \nDownload routes you know you’ll need, such as from your hotel to a museum you plan to visit, \nbefore you leave home, and then access the offline version on Google Maps as needed. \nSelect translation apps and currency converters that work offline if necessary, \nto avoid incurring data charges. \nBook hotels with WiFi included in your room rate so you can stay connected with friends and family daily, without roaming.\n\nAlso select translation apps and currency converters that work offline if necessary, again avoiding incurring data charges. \nA variety of translation apps are available for both iOS and Android that work offline. \nIt’s useful to choose an app that toggles quickly between input and output languages, gives audible translations (to avoid mispronouncing words), \nand stores frequently searched words and phrases for later use. \nTranslation apps that allow the user to speak into the app usually come with a cost, which can be worth the fee if they’re used often. \nRemember that translation apps will get you out of a pinch and help you with basic questions, but will not replace full conversational language.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf you do plan to use data to run apps or post updates to social media during your trip, manage your data use by planning ahead. \nBefore your trip, opt for a short-term international data plan from your cell service provider (usually under $30/month for moderate data plans), \nbuy a subscription to a hot spot service, or buy a SIM card at your destination if you have an unlocked phone.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTo avoid misplacing your phone (or, if necessary, to track a stolen phone), \nconsider enabling Find My iPhone (with an Android equivalent now available at the Google Play store). \nTo find friends or family members while traveling together, enable Find Friends. \nIf phones will be offline, consider purchasing a solution such as GoTenna, \nwhich allows two people to stay in touch via text while phones are offline. \nGoTenna only works when phones are in proximity to one another: use them on cruise ships, in large museums, or theme parks.\n\nWhatever apps you decide to download before your trip, and however you manage your data on the go, \nplan on taking plenty of photos and video, and uploading them to a photo storage site or \nsharing them with friends and family via DropBox or AirDrop after you return home. Enjoy the journey!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYAMY WHITLEY\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmy is a travel writer and editor who has contributed to OutdoorsNW Magazine, Trekaroo.com, and founded PitstopsForKids.com.

But if your fridge is freezing your food, it doesn't mean you need a new fridge. Usually, this issue can be easily diagnosed and repaired. In this article, we'll explain how the refrigeration system works, some of the reasons why food may be freezing in the fresh food section, and what parts you may need to replace to fix your refrigerator.\n\n \n \n \n\nHow Does a Refrigerator Work?\nThe basic operation of a refrigerator is such that we have an evaporator, which is where the cooling portion of the system takes place. It will be located in the freezer, whether it's a side-by-side, or top-mount, or a bottom-mount refrigerator.\nAir from the freezer is then circulated into the fresh food compartment and back into the freezer in a continuous circulation. Typically, we would see about 80% of the air stay inside of the freezer and about 20% go into the fresh food compartment. With that ratio, we typically will get a temperature range of about 0 to +5 Fahrenheit in the freezer and about 36 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit in the fresh food section.\n\nThermostat Control\nIf your fresh food section is cooler than that, you may have a problem with the thermostat control, that's the device that turns the compressor on and off. \nThat thermostat monitors the temperature of the air, either in the freezer or in the fresh food compartment, depending on the model. The typical hydraulic control for a refrigerator consists of a capillary tube that senses the temperature and a set of electrical contacts enclosed in a casing. If it becomes defective, it is a non-serviceable item and will need to be replaced.\nBefore replacing the thermostat control, verify that somebody hasn't inadvertently turned the temperature up too cold. Set it back to the manufacturer's recommended setting, and allow about 24 hours for the temperatures to stabilize in your refrigerator. If that does not solve your problem, then you'll need to replace that control. Shop Replacement Thermostat Controls >\n\nDamper Control\nAnother reason why you may be experiencing freezing temperatures in your fresh food section could be related to the damper control. Most modern refrigerators use an auto damper to control how much air comes into the fresh food section from the freezer. Normally, about 20% will enter the fresh food section, but if the damper for some reason or another, sticks in an open position, you may have more air enter the fresh food and the temperature will drop dramatically.\nThe damper control is typically located in the top section of a side-by-side, or the midsection on a top mount refrigerator. Your freezer temperature air enters from the freezer into the fresh food section. It will either be a flapper type door behind this grill or slide gate to regulate how much air comes into the fresh food.\nIf you're experiencing freezing temperatures in your fresh food compartment, you would suspect that damper assembly should be closed if it's working properly. If it is wide open, that means it is defective or the sensor that controls the damper is defective.\nTo diagnose and repair this issue, begin by making sure that there are no mechanical defects with it that are causing it to be jammed in an open position. Now, if you've determined that there does not appear to be any mechanical issues with your auto damper, the next thing we may suspect is the temp sensor that is associated with that. Most auto dampers will use some type of an electronic temp sensor to control the actual motor that drives the shutter or gate on that auto damper. The temp sensor is typically located somewhere close to that airflow and will often have some type of a connector on the end of it that it can easily be plugged in. Some manufacturers use a hardwired type of temp sensor and it's simply a matter of cutting those leads and splicing in a new one if you need to replace it.\nTo test a temp sensor, we, first of all, need the manufacturer's specifications for that particular sensor and they will indicate the resistance of that sensor at a specific temperature. Normally, they will show something for room temperature and give it a specific ohm reading. We simply need to take our multimeter, connect it to the leads or connector on that temp sensor, and then consult the chart to verify that the reading is what it is supposed to be. If you get a reading that is not consistent with the manufacturer's suggestions, you will need to replace that temp sensor. Shop Replacement Damper Controls >\n\nElectronic Control\nAnother reason why your refrigerator may be freezing in the fresh food section could be related to the electronic control. Many modern refrigerators use electronics to control both the compressor, evaporator, and condenser fans in your refrigerator. Using sensors located throughout your refrigerator, that information is fed back to an electronic control to operate those devices. If the control interprets that data improperly, it may turn on the compressor and fans when they're not necessary.\nTo troubleshoot whether the control is at fault, we, first of all, need to locate that control. On some models, this is located in the control housing at the front. In other models, it may be located on the rear of the refrigerator. Once you have located it, we can then identify where each of the leads is for the individual temp sensors or thermistors located throughout the refrigerator. You can trace those back to the appropriate connector, or we can disconnect that connector and we're able to measure the resistance of those individual thermistors to verify whether they're working properly or not.\nIf we've identified that the thermistors are working normally, we can then suspect that we have a defective control board and that can be replaced.

In short, hiking is a full leg workout. \nAdditionally, no matter if you're hiking up or down, uneven terrain requires a strong core for good balance. \nIf you want to tone your arms, hike with trekking poles, which help lessen the load on your knees by transferring some of it to your arms.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nHow to Train in a City\n\nGyms have many machines that help strengthen the muscles used in hiking. \nUsing these tools can be a quick way to get in good hiking shape – \nif you are the kind of person who enjoys going to the gym. \nFor beginning hikers, a day on the trails can have an especially strong impact on the quadriceps, \nthe large muscle group running across the top of your legs above the knee. \nQuads are used to bend, straighten, and support your knees while you are hiking. \nOn long or steep ascents, your quads will burn because they are activated more than they are while hiking or walking on a flat sidewalk. \nTo help prepare your muscles for the strain of hiking uphill, incorporate exercises that target the quadriceps.\n\nThe stair climber machine is a great place to start, as the motion of climbing stairs is pretty similar to that of hiking uphill. \nAnother good option is the treadmill. Most treadmills have an incline function that allows you to increase its angle, mimicking the angle of a hill. \nMost top out at a 12% grade, which is less steep than most hikes, but this is still a great place to start. \nFor either the stair climber or the treadmill, start with a 10- or 15-minute set of ascending. Don't go too fast! \nThis is a common mistake that beginner hikers make, and it can lead to both injury and misery. \nYou should be moving at a pace that allows for conversation rather than one that requires a lot of breaks. \nAfter 10 or 15 minutes, either lower the angle of the treadmill or ease up on the pace of the stair climber. \nContinue walking at an easy pace for seven minutes and then go back to the harder angle.\n\nIf the gym isn't your scene or isn't in your budget, there are plenty of other training options. \nOne of the easiest is to avoid the elevator and use the stairs. \nTackle a few flights during breaks in your workday or use your lunch break to do a serious stair workout. \nMake sure you go both up and down stairs to prepare your body for the challenge of hiking downhill. \nRunning is another exercise that helps people get in better shape for hiking \nbecause it often includes hills and it develops a strong cardiovascular system. \nIf you're just starting out with running, walking up any hills may make sense. \nFor people with a higher baseline fitness, try running up hills; \nthe increased cardio will help your lungs and body prepare for the hard work of hiking in the mountains.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nA common mistake people make is training without wearing a backpack. \nPractice for success: if you intend to hike with a pretty hefty pack, \nbe sure to walk or run or hit the gym wearing a pack filled with heavy items. Textbooks and weights work well. \nYou don't want to do this every time you train, but a few times will help your body adjust to the increased \neffort required when wearing a pack and will help you break in the pack a little. \nAnother good tip is to wear your hiking boots around to break them in. \nIt may seem like a trivial matter at home, \nbut preparing your feet to prevent blisters is an important consideration. \nBlisters can stop someone in their tracks long before any exhaustion from hiking uphill.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTrain for the Downhills\n\nAs much as hiking can be painful on the uphills, hiking downhill requires more energy. \nThe extension of your legs on downhill stretches can be taxing on your quadriceps in way that the uphill motion isn't. \nGoing downhill generally utilizes more of the stabilizing muscles and tendons in your legs, including those in your ankles. \nHikers are more likely to twist an ankle going downhill than up because of the additional momentum. \nBe sure to incorporate some downhill movements into your training to ensure that your body is properly prepped for the “easy” parts of your hike. \nThis is where the real stairs become important, although in a pinch you could use a big box. \nEither way, spend part of your workout walking down sets of stairs or doing step downs off of a large box at the gym.\n\nMental\n\nIt's amazing how much hiking is about mental ability over physical ability. \nFor most trails and most people, if you have the tenacity to keep going, you will get through the hike in one piece. \nIt may take a long time and require a lot of breaks, but that's not how a hike is judged. \nA successful hike means getting outside and into nature, whether it's for a half-mile, a half an hour, or several days. \nYou choose your goal and define what it means to meet that goal. Get out, enjoy the fresh air, and be proud of your success.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYALISON HUDSON\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlison Hudson is a field instructor for the National Outdoor Leadership School, where she imparts her outdoors knowledge of backcountry and frontcountry camping on students.

Bringing your dog on your next camping trip can be fun for everyone, provided you’ve thought through a few of the hurdles.\n\nPreparing to Bring your Dog Camping\n\nTime to get your dog used to tents, car rides, other animals and pets, and noises. Before any camping trip, set up your tent in the backyard and practice sleeping in it with your dog (or make the kids do this – they’ll enjoy it more). If your dog has a hard time tolerating car rides, ask your vet if any medications are appropriate, and plan to make frequent stops. Be sure your dog is social: arrange for some doggy play dates before you camp, since it’s likely your dog will encounter other dogs at the campground.\n\nBe sure your dog is up-to-date on vaccinations and properly licensed. Check and then double-check the pet policy at the campground or camping resort, first making sure your dog will be allowed. Some campgrounds have a different policy for large dogs versus small dogs, and practically all campgrounds have leash requirements and noise regulations.\n\nPack for your dog: make sure you bring the essentials, just as you do for yourself. Your dog will need water and food bowls, fresh water to drink, and her usual dog food. In addition, pack the usual dog bed or crate used at home. It can help to also include a comfort item, such as a favorite toy or blanket.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\t\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues with Dogs at Campgrounds\n\nMost dogs are beloved at campgrounds, but there’s always one causing a problem, right? To make sure it’s not your dog, follow these easy fixes.\n\nHere’s what to do if:\n\n  Your dog barks at anyone and everyone: First of all, if your dog does this at home (sometimes more prevalent with smaller breeds), you shouldn’t bring her camping. If she is simply overexcited by the other humans and dogs in the campground, consider taking her on a leashed walk at least twice a day to “meet” the neighbors. Never leave a barking dog alone, day or night; your new camping friends will not appreciate it.\n  You need to leave your dog alone at the campsite for a length of time: Firstly, try not to leave your dog unattended – he came with you to be a companion, right? If you do need to leave him, make sure your dog has a safe and reliable place to be contained. Dogs should not be tethered (with a long leash) unattended; instead, use a crate or fencing, or keep your dog in your RV or camper if it remains cool during the day. Be sure to allow for shade and protection from the elements.\n  Your dog is well trained, but others in the vicinity are not: It’s a bummer, but another untrained dog can put a damper on your camping trip. Try explaining the situation to the dog owners first, and, if necessary, go to the camp hosts next. Law enforcement can be called if the dog is dangerous or threatening.\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\t\n\nDog Safety and First Aid\n\nExpect to encounter a few health concerns while camping with your dog that you may not experience at home. In many parts of North America, for instance, ticks are common in wilderness and countryside areas. You’ll want to check your dog for ticks (paying special attention to “hidden” areas, such as the armpits and groin) each day. Consider using a flea and tick collar.\n\nYou can also expect your dog to get his share of mosquito bites. A natural insect and tick repellent spray designed for pets can help alleviate the discomfort of insects while camping, but overall, you’ll be more bothered by biting bugs than your dog.\n\nSome plant species can also harm your dog at a campsite, including stinging nettle or poison oak or ivy. In the case of the latter, it’s unlikely to bother your dog, but will bother you should you pet your dog after exposure.\n\nYour dog will be curious about wildlife while camping, and this is where her training will be most important. If you have a big dog, only other dogs or brown bears could possibly be a threat (if you’re in their habitat). If you have a small dog, coyotes, mountain lions, and sometimes even big birds need to be added to the list to keep an eye out for. Ensure that your dog will respond reliably to a recall and you won’t need to fear wildlife while camping. You can practice this at home before going on your trip.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\t\n\nAlways bring a dog first aid kit when camping with your dog, as it will contain specialized medical supplies to help with common injuries such as torn paw pads, scratches, and ear irritation.\n\nDo a little research and jot down the phone number and address of the closest veterinarian to your campground, just in case. Bring a photocopy of your dog’s health records (easy to request from your usual vet) and keep them in your car. This is a good practice for any type of travel with your pet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYAMY WHITLEY\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmy is a travel writer and editor who has contributed to OutdoorsNW Magazine, Trekaroo.com, and founded PitstopsForKids.com.

Luckily, the secret to keeping your clothes in perfect condition is often staring you right in the face (or tickling the back of your neck)! The signs and symbols on the labels of your clothing show you exactly how to wash and dry each item. To keep your clothes in great condition, check your labels against our guide below to know exactly how each piece should be washed.\n\nWashing\nThe first thing to determine is what cycle you should use. Using the incorrect water temperature, agitation level, or cycle length could cause permanent damage to your clothes. If your washing machine cannot perform the proper cycle, you should always hand wash those items to prevent damage, fading, or wear. \nWhile some washing machines may not have a dedicated Permanent Press or Gentle setting, you can often replicate these conditions by manually selecting spin, temperature, and agitation settings:\n\nThe Permanent Press cycle involves a cooldown or a cold rinse before a reduced spin to prevent new wrinkles from forming during the spin cycle.\nThe Gentle or Delicate setting involves a reduced spin speed and/or length, as well as reduced agitation to prevent damage to your clothes.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDrying\nWhen it comes to drying clothes, it could be argued that following the proper cycle is even more important than when washing clothes. This is because the intense heat put off by your dryer can quickly shrink, melt, or otherwise damage your clothes. If your dryer is unable to perform a cycle that your clothing requires, you should always Line or Drip Dry those items.\nOn many models, the \"No Heat\" cycle is referred to as Cool Dry, Air Dry, or Tumble Dry, all of which mean the same thing!\nSaveEmbed Image\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOther Tags\nIn addition to washing and drying symbols, you may find any of these tags on your clothing labels. If you are ever unsure whether or not a particular item of clothing can be ironed, dry-cleaned, or bleached, you can always refer to the label! As with washing and drying clothes, you should always follow these instructions to prevent unnecessary damage to your clothing\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhile you may have thought these symbols were a foreign language or a branding exercise, learning how to speak the language of clothing tags can extend the life of your clothes exponentially. Additionally, choosing the settings on your dryer can have a large impact on energy efficiency, potentially lowering your power bill as well as decreasing the impact on the environment.\nWe hope that this guide takes the guesswork out of your laundry routine and you never have to worry about improperly washing your clothes again. To make it even easier, print out a copy to hang in your laundry room!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCONTENT TEAM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PartSelect Content Team has a passion for DIY and we pride ourselves on being a resource for quality, expert content to help you accomplish any DIY project.

Catch and release is more than just an angling fad; \nit’s a proven conservation technique that can improve the quality of a sport fishery and, when practiced correctly, ensure there are enough fish for everyone.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nAs fishing grows in popularity and more anglers hit the water, sport-fishing pressure on fisheries increases. \nMost government programs and agencies do a good job of regulating fish size and bag limits for their waters. \nHowever, when left unchecked, heavy fishing pressure combined with anglers keeping their catch can quickly ruin a great fishery. \nPracticing catch and release benefits everyone by ensuring that there are \nalways plenty of fish to catch and that big fish are left to spawn and contribute to the gene pool.\n\nA secondary benefit of catch and release is that it allows biologists to monitor and study fish populations through tagging programs. \nFish species targeted for study are caught by program participants, tagged, and released. \nIf a fish is caught again by anglers, data from the tag along with information about the fish \nand the location where it was captured can be sent to the agency running the program. \nIn addition to encouraging fish conservation and promoting public awareness of catch-and-release practices, \ntagging programs provide biologists with valuable data on fish migration, growth rates, \nhabitat utilization, and mortality associated with both angling and natural events. \nThis data provides accurate information about target fish species and recreational fishing activity that can be used to better manage fisheries.\n\nPracticed responsibly, catch and release can help preserve fish populations. \nHowever, sometimes it can have the opposite effect if anglers don’t pay attention to how they handle and release fish. \nStudies have shown that in well-managed fisheries with catch-and-release practices in effect, the average mortality rate for fish that have been released is around 3%. \nAs sport angling becomes more widespread, fisheries can become inundated with large numbers \nof anglers practicing poor catch-and-release techniques, causing fish mortality to skyrocket and fish populations to decline.\n\nWhere fish populations are healthy and harvesting is legal, keeping a fish or two for the table is an enjoyable aspect of the sport. \nHowever, when dealing with sensitive fisheries or heavy fishing pressure, \nit’s important for responsible anglers to learn and practice proper catch-and-release \ntechniques so that we’ll continue to have healthy fish populations and quality fishing well into the future.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFight the Fish Quickly\n\nIt’s important to realize that despite your best intentions, releasing a fish doesn’t necessarily mean it will survive. \nEnsuring that your prized catch will live on to fight another day starts as soon as the fish is hooked. \nKeep pressure on the fish, and try not to overplay it. Learn the limits of your tackle, and push right up to them. \nBring the fish in as fast as possible to prevent it from becoming exhausted during the battle. \nA fish that’s drained of energy has a much lower chance of survival, even if it’s properly handled and released.\n\nLand the Fish Carefully\n\nWhen the fight is over, it’s still important to take care when landing the fish. \nDragging a fish up onto the bank and allowing it to flop around on shallow rocks or the bottom of your boat will decrease its chances of survival. \nWhenever possible, use a net, and keep the fish in a minimum of six inches of water when landing it.\n\nSome fish such as largemouth and smallmouth bass can be landed without a net by grabbing their lower lip, \nbut trout and other salmonids should not be handled this way. If you have no net, land a small trout by gently cradling the fish under its belly. \nLarger trout, steelhead, and salmon can be landed by taking a firm grip around the base of the fish’s tail. \nJust make sure to always wet your hands before touching the fish so you do not remove the slime coating that protects it from bacteria and parasites.\n\nMost importantly, never attempt to land a fish by putting your fingers into its gills. \nDoing so risks damaging the delicate tissue underneath the gill plate, \nand most fish handled this way will not survive even if they seem fine when released.\n\nPinch Your Barbs\n\nUsing barbless hooks or pinching your barbs will help you unhook the fish quickly and avoid causing unnecessary stress or harm. \nStudies have shown that using barbless hooks increases the survival rates of released fish and, \ncompared to fishing with barbs, has very little effect on an angler’s ability to successfully land a fish.\n\nHandle the Fish as Little as Possible\n\nIf you don’t plan to take a picture, it’s best to release the fish without handling it at all: use your pliers or a quick-release tool to unhook the fish while it’s still in the water. \nIf you must handle the fish, make sure your hands are wet and gently cradle it beneath the belly, supporting its body weight. \nYou can grip the fish firmly, but avoid squeezing it. Fish have delicate internal organs that can be easily ruptured under too much pressure.\n\nKeep ‘Em Wet\n\nKeep the fish and its gills submerged in the water at all times when unhooking and handling it. \nImagine competing in a wrestling match for several minutes and then being held underwater while you’re trying to catch your breath. \nYou wouldn’t last very long, would you? Neither would a fish when held out of the water after a long fight.\n\nTaking Photos\n\nIf you’d like to take a picture of your fish, keep it in the water until your camera \nand photographer are fully prepared. Consider keeping the fish partially submerged for the photo. \nIf you wish to take the fish out of the water, do it quickly and then return it to the water as fast as possible. \nTake several shots at once to avoid repeatedly lifting the fish out of the water. \nA simple rule of thumb is to hold the fish out of the water no longer than you can hold your breath.\n\nRelease the Fish Properly\n\nReleasing the fish correctly is just as important to its survival as fighting and handling it right. \nAn exhausted fish released into a heavy current or flung haphazardly over the side of your boat has little chance of survival. \nIf you’re in a river, find a spot where the current is soft but steady, and point the fish upstream. \nAllow it to swim away from you under its own power. In a lake, hold the fish gently below the surface and let it swim away when it’s ready. \nIf you’re in a boat and can’t reach the water’s surface, point the fish’s head toward the water and drop \nit so it penetrates the surface like a spear. Never throw a fish, and avoid releasing fish into stagnant water or a heavy current.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nSometimes a fish will get exhausted even if you fight it quickly and handle it correctly. \nTreating the fish with extra care before release will increase its chances of survival.\n\nHow to Tell If a Fish Is Exhausted\n\nAn exhausted fish will appear very weak and lie completely still. \nIf allowed to swim free, it may lose its equilibrium and float to the surface belly up.\n\nReviving an Exhausted Fish\n\nIt’s important to gently hold onto the fish until it’s ready to swim away on its own. If you’re in a river where there’s a current, \nfind a spot where the current is soft but steady, and hold the fish facing upstream to allow fresh water to pass through its gills. \nIf you’re in still water, it can help to guide the fish slowly back and forth in an “S” motion to increase the flow of oxygenated water over its gills. \nBe patient and let the fish tell you when it’s ready to be released. \nWhen it regains strength, it will attempt to swim away on its own, and you can relax your grip.\n\nReleasing a fish and watching it swim away strong can be one of the most fulfilling aspects of fishing. \nWhen practiced correctly, catch-and-release techniques can help us maintain healthy fisheries for years into the future, \nso that our children and even their children can have the same opportunities to enjoy the quality fishing we have today.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCHARLIE ROBINTON\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Robinton has loved fly fishing since he was 10 years old.

Fixing your refrigerator yourself, rather than hiring an expensive repair tech can save you time and money!\nOne of the most common sounds to come from a refrigerator is a cracking or popping noise, which is usually the result of components and panels of the fridge contracting and expanding in response to a temperature change. This is particularly common in fridges that are “frost-free”. However, in addition to “regular” noises made by your refrigerator, a strange noise coming from the appliance could suggest that one or more parts are defective. Which is why you should always inspect the following parts prior to assuming they are routine noises:\n\n \n \n \n\nCondenser Fan Motor Assembly\nOne of the most common causes of noise from your refrigerator is the condenser fan motor assembly. It is located at the back of the refrigerator, close to the floor, and typically is behind a cardboard or metal access panel. To inspect it, you want to look for a damaged fan blade with any part of the blade bent, distorted, or missing. You'll also want to check to make sure that it is tight on the motor shaft and that the motor shaft is not loose in the motor bushings. Shop Replacement Condenser Fan Motor Assemblies >\n\nEvaporator Fan Motor & Blade\nAnother common cause for noise in a refrigerator is the evaporator fan motor. The evaporator fan motor is located next to the evaporator in the freezer section and there's usually a metal cover in front of it. To inspect it, first make sure that there's nothing that has gotten into the vent area that may be interfering with the blade. Then remove that cover to inspect the evaporator fan motor and blade assembly. Verify that that blade turns freely and is not damaged, that the motor is mounted firmly in the bracket, and that the shaft is nice and snug with no excess play in it. Shop Replacement Evaporator Fan Motor & Blades >\n\nCompressor\nA less common cause for noise in a refrigerator could be related to the compressor. Unlike an evaporator fan or condenser fan motor noise, which typically has a consistent ticking sound or a scraping sound, a compressor noise is more likely to be a knocking sound that might occur when the compressor starts, and perhaps again when it shuts off. The compressor is typically located at the rear of the refrigerator, close to the bottom, and would be located behind an access panel. To inspect it, verify that the rubber mounts on the bottom are intact and not damaged. If you have a sound similar to a knocking sound that occurs once when the compressor starts and again when it ends, you may have a defect inside of the compressor with the suspension springs. Shop Replacement Compressors >\n\nWater Inlet Valve\nAnother less common cause for noise in a refrigerator could be related to a water valve. Models with an ice maker or an ice and water dispenser through the door will have a water valve located at the back of the refrigerator. To inspect it, remove the rear panel, locate the valve, and determine if the noise is coming from the valve. If it is, determine how frequently it is making the noise. If you hear a loud buzzing sound once every three or four hours, that would typically indicate that the ice makers portion of that valve is defective. If you only hear it when you dispense water through the front, it would indicate that the dispenser portion is defective. Shop Replacement Water Inlet Valves > \n\nWrap-up\nWhile a noisy refrigerator can be unnerving, it is often an issue that can be fixed easily without needing a professional. If you are unsure of how to diagnose or replace any of these parts, don't worry!

It all comes down to knowing the function of the basic equipment. \nFrom there, you can experiment with alternatives. And as with many creative activities, \nthe necessary tools depend on the material – in this case, the type of icing. Choose the tools that serve your design plans best.\n\nParchment Paper: It’s not just for lining cake pans! As a versatile kitchen component, \nparchment paper is handy for protecting your work surface. It provides a clean, smooth area for your ingredients.\n\nTurntable: Also known as a lazy Susan, this tool is a cake holder that rotates, allowing you to work on all sides of the cake with ease.\n\nScissors: This useful tool can be used to cut parchment paper, fondant, and more.\n\nBowls: Keep an assortment of bowls and containers in different sizes nearby. \nThese are exceptionally suitable for mixing frosting or housing edible accessories while you work.\n\nToothpick: A toothpick serves as the perfect tool for creating texture, indentations, and guides. It’s also perfect for mixing colors into icing.\n\nOffset Spatula: The elongated surface of an offset spatula covers more surface area that a normal spatula. \nThis one is used to spread buttercream evenly across a cake.\n\nBench Scraper: After buttercream has been spread out, a bench scraper can smooth it further.\n\nPastry Bag, Decorating Tips, and Tube Coupler: The top edge of a pastry bag has a wide opening so it can be easily filled with buttercream; the opposite narrow end has a small hole. \nA decorative tip is attached to this end and secured with a tube coupler. Decorative tips are available in different shapes, each one producing a unique design.http://oldrecipebook.com/cakedecoratingtools.shtml\n\nSharp Knife or X-ACTO® Blade: These simple tools are ideal for slicing cake edges and fondant. They can also be used for creating texture and indentations.\n\nFondant Rollers: Rollers made specifically for fondant have smooth, firm surfaces. \nThey’re essential for rolling fondant into a layer that is thin enough to work with. \nUnlike traditional wooden rolling pins, fondant rollers won’t leave grooves or lines.\n\nFondant Smoother: After applying a sheet of fondant, a fondant smoother can be used to remove pesky air bubbles.\n\nPaintbrush: A basic craft paintbrush is useful for adding sugar water (“glue”) and applying edible glitter or powder. It can also be used to create texture.\n\nTime to Decorate!\n\nIf you’re decorating a cake for a huge event, do a test run. This will give you the chance to practice techniques and get to know the tools. \nYou’ll be glad you did. Don’t forget to use the internet to your advantage; there are many video tutorials and guides available around the web.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFrosting\n\nButtercream Frosting Recipe\n\nKnown for its rich and soft texture, buttercream is easy to pipe and spread. \nAnd while it can be purchased at the grocery store, it’s extremely easy to make at home.https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/12/buttercream-vs-fondant/  \nSince many prefer the sweet taste of buttercream, it’s often the go-to for both fillings and decoration. \nIt also provides a surface for fondant to stick to. Here’s how to make homemade buttercream.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n\t\t\t3 cups confectioners’ sugar\n\t\t\t½ to 1 teaspoons clear vanilla extract (to taste)\n\t\t\n\n\nHow-To:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1. With an electric mixer, beat the butter at medium speed until smooth.\n\t\t\t2. Slowly add the sugar in increments, mixing at low speed.\n\t\t\t3. Add the vanilla and mix at medium speed until thoroughly combined.\n\t    \n\n\nAdapted from The Kitchn\n\nTips:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUse clear, not brown, vanilla extract to make a pure white buttercream. This will create an ideal base for adding color.\n\t\t\tButtercream is susceptible to heat and humidity. Work in a cool, dry area.\n\t\t\tIf the buttercream is too thin, add more confectioners’ sugar. If it’s too tough, bring in milk or water.\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nClassic Fondant Recipe\n\nWhile it may sound like a fancy treat, fondant is made of simple ingredients. \nThis smooth and sweet candy dough is similar to clay and is placed over buttercream. \nIt’s exceptionally fun to shape and mold. And while it’s a little tricky to work with, it offers so much design potential.\n\nOnce applied to a cake, fondant stays put and does not budge easily. Like buttercream, it can be purchased in the store or made at home. \nReady-made versions can be purchased by roll or in a tub; the latter needs to be rolled out into a thin sheet. \nFondant can also be made at home, but requires at least one hour. If you’re up to the challenge check out this recipe.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2 cups granulated sugar\n\t\t\t½ cup water\n\t\t\t2 tablespoons corn syrup\n\t\t\n\n\nHow-To:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1. Over medium heat, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup.\n\t\t\t2. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely.\n\t\t\t3. Bring to a boil.\n\t\t\t4. Do not stir the mixture as the corn syrup cooks.\n\t\t\t5. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature. Once it reaches 234-240 degrees F, pour the mixture onto clean, hard surface that has been sprinkled with water. A baking sheet or marble countertop are ideal options.\n\t\t\t6. Let cool for 3 minutes.\n\t\t\t7. Dampen a wooden spoon or fondant smoother with water. Vigorously work the fondant by pushing it around in a figure-eight pattern. It will begin to cream and become opaque.\n\t\t\t8. Once it becomes stiff, knead it like dough with moistened hands.\n\t\t\t9. Eventually, it will become smooth and stiff. Your fondant is now ready.\n\t\t\n\n\nTips:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMake sure your hands are free of dirt and debris before handling fondant.\n\t\t\tIf you mess up while working with a fondant shape, just roll it up and try again.\n\t\t\n\n\nAdapted from About Food and Food Network.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRoyal Icing Recipe\n\nRoyal icing is a type of frosting that starts out soft and hardens over time.\nThe finished texture is dry and firm, making it a travel-friendly choice. \nHowever, royal icing is primarily used for decoration and doesn’t have much flavor. Here’s how to make it.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2 cups confectioners’ sugar\n\t\t\t1 large egg white\n\t\t\t½ teaspoon water or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\t\t\n\n\nHow-To:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1. Combine sugar, egg white, and liquid in a bowl.\n\t\t\t2. Mix with a wooden spoon or electric mixture until smooth and thick.\n\t\t\n\n\nAdapted from Food Network and Real Simple.\n\nTips:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIf the icing is too thick, add a small amount of water.\n\t\t\tUse the “10 second rule” to determine if your icing is ready. Drag a butter knife across the surface. If it takes more than 10 seconds to smooth over, add a bit of water. If it takes less than 5 seconds, add some sugar. If it takes 5-10 seconds to become smooth, it’s ready.\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFood Dyes\n\nSince basic frosting is white, you have the freedom to liven things up with concentrated edible dyes. \nAnd much like mixing paints, different color combinations will yield different hues. It’s enough to make any color theory nerd swoon.\n\nGel or Paste: Available at grocery and craft stores, this option is ideal for fondant. A little goes a long way.\n\nLiquid: With a lighter consistency than gel and paste, liquid dye is excellent for buttercream. \nIt’s also available at grocery and craft stores in batches of primary colors. Combine with buttercream using a toothpick. Learn more abouthow to color icing for all your baking needs!\n\nTips:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAvoid adding more vanilla extract (regular or clear) to the icing. This may alter the finished shade.\n\t\t\tNeed help creating the perfect color? Refer to a color-mixing guide designed just for icing.\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nEdible Acccessories\n\nYou can upgrade your cake with ready-made edible accessories. \nThey can add intriguing texture, eye-catching details, and extra dimension. \nAnd since they’re usually made of sugar and food coloring, \nedible accessories can be found in a wide assortment of shapes, colors, and finishes.\n\nRoyal Icing Decorations: These firm, tasteless shapes are available in shapes like pumpkins and flowers. They are sturdy and dry.\n\nPiping Gel: This colored gel comes in a small plastic tube. It’s handy for creating words, patterns, and drawings.\n\nSprinkles: Aside from the traditional “jimmies,” you can find sprinkles in a wide variety of shapes and colors. \nMany bottles of themed sprinkles contain an assortment of different sprinkles.\n\nDust: Edible dust is amazing for adding a fairy-like, metallic finish. It can be brushed or sprinkled onto a cake.\n\nGlitter: Often made of colored sugar crystals, edible glitter is another superb option for adding sparkle and shine to your creation.\n\nPearls: Small and shiny round “beads” made of sugar are known as edible pearls. They’re frequently used to create borders or jewel-like details.\n\nEdible Photos: Pre-made edible photos of sports teams and cartoon characters can be found around the web and in stores. \nAlternatively, you can order a custom-made version that, for example, displays an image of the celebrant or a team mascot.\n\nNow that you’re armed with pro-level knowledge, all you need is some practice. \nDon’t be afraid to experiment with small cakes in the comfort of your own home. \nBefore you know it, you’ll be transforming cakes into beautiful works of art.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYKIRSTEN NUNEZ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKirsten Nunez is a lifestyle author based out of New York.

First, you need to understand what kind of ribs to buy. \nThat can be daunting when you head to the grocery store butcher section. Keep your eye out for two different cuts – baby back and St. Louis spare ribs. \nBaby back ribs are a thick cut located near the ever-so-tender loin region of the pig. \nSpare ribs are located more toward the lower portion of the rib area at the pig’s sternum. \nThe St. Louis cut of the spare rib has the chewy cartilage and breast bone portion removed. \nIf you are going to smoke spare ribs, I suggest going with the St. Louis cut. \nWhat follows are the principles of rib preparation, dry rub, and cooking method.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf it’s necessary, preparing ribs involves removing the tough membrane. In some cases, the butcher will have already removed the membrane from the ribs – \nwhen purchasing your ribs you can simply ask the butcher whether the membrane has been removed, which will save you some time. \nIf it hasn’t, first rinse the ribs in some cold water. Flip the ribs over so the bottom of the rack is facing up. \nUse a dull butter knife and insert it right below the hazy white membrane covering the entire bottom of the ribs. \nWiggle the knife around a little bit to loosen the membrane. In your other hand, grab the membrane with a few dry paper towels, \nand once you get a solid grip on it, pull it off the entire bottom of the rack.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOnce your ribs have been prepared and rinsed, liberally apply a BBQ dry rub. \nA recipe for a simple dry rub is as follows:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1/4 cup of paprika \n\t\t\t2 tbsp dark brown sugar \n\t\t\t2 tbsp ground black pepper \n\t\t\t1 tbsp chili powder \n\t\t\t2 tsp garlic powder \n\t\t\t2 tsp dry mustard powder \n\t\t\t1 tsp kosher salt \n            1 tsp cayenne pepper\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nMix the dry ingredients together and apply to both sides of the ribs. I find it easiest to do this on a baking sheet covered by aluminum foil. \nPlace the racks of ribs in the refrigerator overnight to let the dry rub flavors penetrate the meat. \nIf you can’t rub the ribs the night before, add the rub at least 1-2 hours prior to smoking.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nSmoking ribs is rather easy once you understand the basic formula. The idea is that you smoke the ribs directly on the smoker grate for a period of time. \nThen you wrap the ribs in foil with a liquid seasoning of your choice and continue cooking, and finally you unwrap the ribs for the final stage of cooking. \nThis process allows for some fantastic smoke penetration and allows the ribs to become extremely tender since the ribs are foiled for a period. \nThis foiling is referred to as the “Texas crutch.” For baby back ribs the formula is 2:2:1. \nThat means 2 hours directly on the smoker grate, then 2 hours wrapped in foil, then 1 hour unwrapped. \nFor St. Louis spare ribs, the formula is similar but calls for an extra hour in the first step, so the formula is 3:2:1. \nThis means 3 hours directly on the grate, then 2 hours wrapped in foil, followed by 1 hour unwrapped for some final smoke penetration and addition of sauce.\n\nTo get going, fire up the smoker to a typical BBQ smoker temperature of 225-275 degrees F. Anywhere in this range and you’ll be okay. \nOn top of the charcoal you’ll want to have a smoke wood to provide the smoky flavor. \nIf you are looking for a more intense smoke experience, choose mesquite smoke wood. For a milder smoky flavor choose apple or cherry.\n\nAfter the initial 2 or 3 hours directly on the smoker, you'll be wrapping the ribs in heavy duty aluminum foil (to avoid accidental puncture and loss of all your liquid). \nWhen wrapping the ribs for this second phase of smoking, you can add about ½ to 1 cup of liquid on top of the ribs. \nAnything from apple juice to your favorite ale will work. You can even be creative and add some honey for sweeter ribs.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nSo you've gone through the cooking process and have spent 2 or 3 hours directly on the grate, \nan additional 2 hours wrapped in foil with your liquid of choice, and now you’re back on the grill grates. \nWhat’s next? This final hour is the time to brush on some of your favorite BBQ sauce. \nAny store-bought BBQ sauce will work just fine, and of course you can use any online BBQ sauce recipe. \nNear the end of this final hour, pick up the ribs using BBQ gloves and give them a slight “bend.” If the ribs tear just a little between the bones, they are done. \nIf the ribs refuse to tear at all, you will need some more time. Cooked ribs can range anywhere from very tough to overly tender (“fall off the bone”). \nYour preference will probably be somewhere in between. I prefer to have a little bit of a bite to the ribs, \nso I pull them off at the first sign of tearing when you bend them. Of course, there is nothing wrong with “fall off the bone” ribs!\n\nHowever you choose to rub, cook, slather, and eat your ribs, adhering to the above principles will create a result that’s tender, \ndelicious, and perfectly cooked to your preferred taste. Enjoy (and keep the napkins handy)!\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYJOHN THOMAS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Thomas is a grilling expert who resides outside Baltimore.

Modern fly rod designs vary greatly depending on the intended use, \nso it is important to understand the mechanics and basic design characteristics of fly rods when selecting between the different options available.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nLength\n\nThese days, manufacturers offer rods varying in length from as short as 6 feet to as long as 15 feet. \nIn general, rods on either end of the length spectrum are meant for specific applications, \nwhile rods that fall in the center of the spectrum are more versatile. \nA 9-foot fly rod is considered standard length: with a 9-foot rod, an angler can cast effectively \nat most fishing distances and control the line on the water, making 9 feet a great choice for most anglers in common situations.\n\nSo why go shorter or longer? Shorter rods excel in casting accuracy and have greater leverage. \nRods that are 6–8 feet are often sold in light weights for fishing small streams where casting room can be an issue. \nAlso, some new heavyweight rod models are being manufactured in \nshort lengths for casting big flies into tight spots and wrestling powerful fish out of their snaggy homes. \nThese short, stout rods excel in targeting fish like largemouth bass, snook, \nand juvenile tarpon in areas where casting accuracy and leverage are important.\n\nRods longer than 9 feet offer the angler two distinct advantages: casting distance and line control. \nRods in the category of 10–12 feet are becoming popular for anglers that specialize in \nnymph fishing for trout because the added length allows an angler to hold more line off the water, \nwhich aids in control and reduces unwanted drag. In addition to improving reach, more length helps with mending and line control, \nenabling an angler to present the fly effectively at greater distances. If distance is desired, a longer rod may be the perfect fit. \nSpey rods, or two-handed fly rods in the range of the 11–15 feet, are tailor made for casting and fishing at long distances. \nA two-handed rod in the hands of a skilled caster can easily deliver a fly at distances of 60 to more than 100 feet. \nLong, two-handed rods are popular for steelhead and salmon anglers who fish large rivers, and with beach anglers who need to cast far into the surf.\n\nWeight\n\nThe spectrum of rod weights on the market today is almost as great as rod lengths, \nwith models offered from as light as 0-weight to as heavy as 16. Almost every weight has a practical application, \nbut fly anglers also have some general favorites. For example, the 9-foot, \n5-weight is widely considered to be the most popular trout fishing fly rod in the world.\n\nIn general, fly rods of a certain weight are also manufactured in specific lengths to suit an intended purpose. \nA quick glance at the inventory at a local fly shop will show that most lightweight rods in the 0–3 weight range are manufactured in shorter lengths. \nThis is because they are mostly used for small stream or pond fishing, where shorter length is an advantage and the fish are generally small. \nRods in the 4–8 weight category can come in more varied lengths, and comprise the bulk of what most freshwater anglers need for targeting a variety of fish species. \nWeights 4, 5, and 6 are the most popular sizes for targeting trout, while heavier weights are used for targeting larger fish or casting large, heavy flies. \nRods in the 9–16 weight category are generally only used for very large freshwater fish or saltwater applications,\nwith the 12–16 weights being designed specifically for big game species such as tarpon, giant trevally, sailfish, and tuna.\n\nAction\n\nRod action has to do with how the rod flexes under the weight of the line during the casting stroke, \nand then how it transfers that energy into the line to create the cast. \nMost fly rods on the market fall into 1 of 3 categories: fast, medium, or slow. \nThis categorization has to do with how fully the rod bends when placed under a load, \nand how quickly the rod recovers to a straight position when the load is released.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFast Action\n\nFast-action rods flex mostly in the top third of the rod when placed under a load, and they recover quickly when the load is released. \nThe lower portion of the rod is stiff and powerful, while the tip is supple and flexible, allowing for precision casting, line control, and distance. \nFast-action fly rods are popular for their high-performance characteristics, \nbut these same strengths can make them difficult to handle for beginning fly anglers.\n\nMedium Action\n\nMedium-action rods flex from the top half of the fly rod and recover more slowly than fast-action rods. \nThe general feel is similar to that of a fast-action rod, \nbut the additional flex makes them smoother and more forgiving to cast. \nMedium-action rods are great general purpose tools and are easier for most beginner to intermediate fly anglers. \nAdvanced casters will still appreciate their deeper flex characteristics for specific applications.\n\nSlow Action\n\nSlow-action fly rods feature the fullest flex, bending deep into the butt when placed under a load and recovering slowly when the load is removed. \nThis flex profile is valued for creating a soft, delicate presentation or \nwhen the angler needs the rod to load up and cast a very short amount of line, such as when fishing in a brushy creek. \nSlow-action rods are mainly used for specific purposes, and represent a small subset of fly rods and actions on the market.\n\nRod Construction\n\nThe three main construction materials used in fly rod manufacturing are graphite, fiberglass, and bamboo. \nEach one is appreciated for its own performance characteristics and distinct feel.\n\nGraphite is the most popular and widely used material used for fly rod construction. The material is lightweight, sensitive, flexible, and incredibly strong. \nManufacturers can apply graphite in different layups and tapers when building rod blanks to achieve almost any desired action or feel, \nmaking graphite an incredibly versatile material for fly rod building. The lightest, strongest, \nand highest performance fly rods on the market are made of graphite. \nThe only real disadvantage is that graphite fibers can be brittle and a bit fragile. \nFinished fly rods are protected by a layer of epoxy resin, but anglers still need to take care when fishing and storing their rods.\n\nFiberglass was replaced by graphite in the 1980s as the material of choice for fly rod construction, but its distinct feel and durability keep it relevant. \nFiberglass fly rods are still offered by many of the top rod manufacturers. While it is a bit heavier and less sensitive than graphite, \nfiberglass is flexible and durable. Most fiberglass rods in shops these days are offered in slow-action, \nfull-flex profiles and in lighter weights from 1–5. In general, they are meant for small streams and lakes where anglers are targeting small- to medium-sized fish. \nHowever, a few anglers have discovered that the incredible strength and flexibility of fiberglass \nis an advantage when targeting large powerful fish, and are using rods in the category of 8–12 weight to fight and land some impressive specimens.\n\nBamboo has withstood the test of time as one of the best natural materials for fly rod construction. \nWhile it has been replaced by stronger and lighter modern materials, \nit still has its place in fly fishing. Bamboo has a natural full flex and a wonderful feel, \nand it is prized by anglers who appreciate the lively feel when casting and fighting a fish on a bamboo rod. It is not for everyone, or everything, \nand anglers looking for a general purpose rod or a first fly rod might want to look elsewhere. \nBut, for those who are looking for a rod with a truly unique feel, one that makes it a joy to fish, bamboo may be the answer.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Reel?\n\nFly fishing reels come in various shapes and constructions. Some designs are purely aesthetic, while some serve important functions. \nThis guide will help you understand the most important aspects to consider when choosing a reel to match a fly rod.\n\nConstruction Material\n\nQuality fly reels are typically made of aluminum, but not all are created equal. \nA high-end reel will be machined from solid bar stock aluminum and finished with an anodizing process, protecting it from scratches and corrosion. \nLess expensive reels are often die cast from aluminum alloys, and are more prone to bending or breaking if dropped. \nSpending a little extra to get a machined aluminum reel will pay off in the long run.\n\nArbor Size\n\nThe arbor is a term fly fishers use to describe the diameter of the inside of the reel spool. \nA reel with a small diameter spool is referred to as a small arbor, \nwhile a reel with a large diameter spool is said to have a large arbor. \nAlso, many options are on the market that fall somewhere in the middle, called mid-arbor reels. \nLarge-arbor reels were originally developed by big-game \nfly anglers who needed to be able to retrieve line quickly while fighting large, \nfast-moving fish. The large-arbor design has the added advantage of holding the fly line in looser coils, \nso it is not as prone to tangling while fishing.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDrag\n\nDrag is perhaps the most important performance characteristic on modern fly reels. Drag mechanisms range from click-pawl, \nwhich is simply a gear that clicks against a metal spring, to fully sealed, fully adjustable carbon fiber disc systems. \nA smooth drag system is an important consideration when fishing with extremely light tippets or whenever large, powerful fish are the targeted quarry. \nIn contrast, an angler fishing small streams for trout that seldom get above 10 inches may never even use a drag. \nSaltwater anglers will appreciate having a sealed drag system.\n\nWhen choosing a reel, consider the weight of the fly rod and the intended use. \nMost manufacturers label their reels with the suggested matching line weight, \nand this can be a good starting guide to help you pick the right size.\n\nMatching The Right Line to Your Rod\n\nHaving the right fly line can mean the difference between a successful day and a very frustrating experience on the water. \nIt is not only important to match the correct weight fly line to your rod, but to also choose the correct taper and sink rate. \nThese days, many options are on the market, and it can get a bit confusing. \nThis guide will help you understand the basics so that you can choose the best option for the fishing you will be doing.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTaper\n\nAll fly lines have a taper, meaning if the fly line was stretched from end to end, the thickness would not be uniform. \nInstead, the mass in the fly line is distributed where it is needed most for specific casting characteristics.\nAlthough a variety of line tapers are available on the market today, most are simply variations of the basic weight-forward taper. \nThis taper design places most of the mass in the first 30–50 feet of the line, at the distance where most anglers are comfortable casting and fishing. \nThe remainder of the line is thin and level, which makes it perfect for shooting line, should an angler need to reach a greater distance. \nThe weight-forward taper is by far the most versatile and popular taper design, and should be your first choice when looking for a new fly line.\n\nDensity\n\nFly lines come in floating, sinking-tip, and full-sinking variations. \nYour line choice should be dictated by where you want to deliver your fly in the water column.\n\nFloating\n\nFloating fly lines are the most common, and often the best choice for general purpose angling. \nThey are appropriate for delivering a fly anywhere between the surface and around 6 feet deep. \nAny deeper, and a sinking or sink-tip line would be a better choice. \nAnd, don’t make the mistake of thinking you need a sinking line to fish nymphs or other subsurface flies: \na floating line coupled with a long leader and a weighted fly is a common and deadly tactic for delivering a fly below the surface.\n\nSink Tip\n\nSink-tip lines are effective for delivering a fly from just below the surface to around 10 feet deep. \nA sink-tip line is a floating line that transitions into a sinking tip in the last 8–15 feet of the fly line. \nBecause the back end still floats, they are easier than full-sinking lines to pick up off the water when making a new cast. \nThe floating rear end also helps anglers make mends and adjustments when drifting a fly in current. \nSink tips come in different sink rates that are measured in inches per second. \nA low sink rate would be considered 1–2 inches per second, while 8–10 inches per second is about as fast as you will find.\n\nFull Sinking\n\nFull-sinking lines are used when an angler needs to keep the fly below the surface at a sustained depth throughout the retrieve, \nor when the fly needs to be delivered at extreme depths up to 20-plus feet. Like sink-tip fly lines, \nfull-sinking lines are offered in multiple sink rates. The sink rate is chosen based on how deep the fly needs to be throughout the retrieve. \nAn intermediate fly line that sinks at 1–2 inches per second is a good choice for presenting a fly in the top 2 feet of the water column. \nA medium sink rate from 3–5 inches per second is a good general purpose choice. \nFor achieving extreme depths or keeping a fly below the surface in heavy current, a fast sink rate of 8–10 inches per second is appropriate. \nWith any sink rate, the longer one waits after the cast before retrieving the fly, the deeper it will go. \nFull-sinking lines are popular with stillwater and saltwater fishermen who often use subsurface presentations to target deep holding fish.\n\nHow to Choose The Best Outfit For You\n\nWhen choosing a new fly fishing outfit, it is important to consider where you will be fishing, the species you will be targeting, and the methods you will be using. \nThese three considerations will largely determine the length, weight, and action of the fly rod as well as the reel and line that will be matched. \nHere are some general suggestions based on experience, but the options are limitless when tailored specifically to your individual needs.\n\nGeneral Purpose For Small- to Medium-sized Fish\n\nA 9-foot, 5-weight, medium-action fly rod coupled with a mid-arbor reel with a disc drag system and a floating, \nweight-forward fly rod is a perfect choice for general purpose freshwater fishing. \nThe 9-foot, 5-weight can handle trout of all sizes and many warmwater species such as panfish and bass. \nThe floating fly line will be best suited for fishing in streams, lakes, \nand ponds on or near the surface where anglers are most likely to encounter fish.\n\nSmall Stream Fishing\n\nA 7- to 8-foot, 2- to 4-weight, slow- to medium-action fly rod coupled with a small, \nlightweight aluminum reel and a weight-forward floating line to match the rod is a great choice for small streams and mountain lakes. \nIn many such places, the biggest challenge is finding room to cast, giving the shorter length an advantage over longer rods. \nA lighter weight, full-flexing fly rod will load up better in close quarters \nwhen you might only be casting with 5–10 feet of fly line, and will be more sporting when fighting smaller fish.\n\nGeneral Purpose For Larger Fish\n\nA 9-foot, 7- to 9-weight, fast-action fly rod coupled with a large-arbor disc drag reel and a weight-forward, \nfloating line is a good general purpose choice for larger fish. \nThe heavier weight, fast-action rod will provide the casting power and leverage to fish with larger flies and fight bigger fish. \nA large arbor reel with a good disc drag will provide fast line pickup and smooth fish stopping power during the fight. \nThe weight-forward line is still the best all-around choice, \nbut anglers fishing in specific situations may want to look at sink-tip or full-sinking options.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCHARLIE ROBINTON\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Robinton has loved fly fishing since he was 10 years old.

The distinguishing factor of a musci moss is the clear differentiation between their leaves and stems. \nSome varieties have stems that are upright, while others have stems that are matted down on the surface of the ground. \nThe most common musci mosses are Sphagnum and Hypnaceae, and they are wonderful for use as soil amendments or for stand-alone DIY projects.\n\nHepaticae, also known as liverworts, are identifiable by how soft they are to the touch. \nThey do well in shady areas near water, and prefer high humidity. \nIf you live in a low humidity or drier area, you’ll need to give extra care to your Hepaticae plants if you want them to do well.\n\nAnthocerotae, also known as hornworts, are the third type of bryophyte. \nThey’re readily distinguishable by their pointed branches that bear all of their spores. \nLike Hepaticae, they prefer damp, high-humidity environments, but they also like a reasonable amount of sun. \nAnthocerotae are also the rarest type of moss, with the fewest species of the three.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf there is a golden rule of moss care, it would be this: Mimic the environment that moss thrives in.\n\nFor most mosses, this means a damp, well-lit area with high humidity. \nBut before we get into the finer details of moss care, here are some tools you’ll need to care for your moss gardens:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPincers: These are used to place moss, propagate it, and remove dead areas in a delicate manner. Try to get pincers with a flat spatula design in order to smooth moss out over a surface.\n\t\t\tSpray Bottle: Used both for watering and to increase the humidity in your moss garden environment.\n\t\t\tScissors: Used to cut off dead leaves as well as to control and shape the look of your garden. Try to get the sharpest scissors you can so as to do minimal damage to your moss.\n\t\t\tTrowel: If you’re transferring soil into pots or containers to create your moss garden, you’ll need a standard trowel.\n\t\t\tGloves: Although moss isn’t harmful to the touch, you may want to protect your hands from dirt and mess.\n\t\t\n\n\nThe most important part of caring for moss is watering it appropriately. \nUnlike many other plants, it requires more care with regards to watering as we can see from its natural environments. \nMoss has no root system to pull moisture from the soil, so all of its water must be taken from the atmosphere and environment.\n\nWhen watering your moss, you can either mist it, soak it, or water it with a shower nozzle watering can. \nThe key here is to water only when your moss needs it – typically when the color is faded and it’s dry to the touch.\n\nYou do not need to fertilize moss. In fact, fertilizing it with a strong nutrient solution will actually cause it to turn brown and die. \nHowever, if you’ve wrapped moss around another plant (like in a kokedama), \nthen you should use a highly-diluted nutrient mixture to mist and/or soak the moss so you can feed the plant inside it.\n\nIf you’re growing moss outdoors, you’re in luck. You have the opportunity to mimic exactly \nhow moss grows in nature, which means you should locate it in a well-lit area (but not over-exposed to light) \naway from strong wind gusts. Remember, moss gets all of the nutrients it needs from the sun – you don’t need to locate it on soil.\n\nIf you’re growing moss indoors, it needs to be in a bright spot with decent air circulation. \nA common mistake is to place moss in a darker area under the assumption that this will keep humidity high. \nDo not make this mistake! Moss needs light to photosynthesize all of the nutrients it needs to survive.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nThe beauty of using moss in the garden is its versatility. \nYou can use it as ground cover, as a “paint,” or in a completely independent hanging planter.\n\nMoss Kokedamas: “Kokedama” is a Japanese word for growing a plant in a ball of tightly-wrapped moss instead of soil. \nThese are an offshoot of the bonsai culture in Japan and make a striking addition to an indoor or outdoor garden.\n\nTo make a kokedama, you’ll need peat soil, sand, akadama, soil, some charcoal, and a moss of your choice. \nMix the soil together and form it into a ball, packing it around the roots of the plant you’re using, \nand then attach the moss around the outside of the soil ball. \nAll you need to do now is fasten the moss to the soil ball with twine or fishing line to ensure it stays on.\n\nMoss Bonsais: Moss can be used as a ground cover for a traditional bonsai tree, but it can also be a bonsai project on its own. \nBecause moss resembles blades of grass when viewed from a distance, \nartists and gardeners around the world have used it as a way to create mini-landscapes in small containers. \nYou can add small wildflowers, mountain grasses, rocks, and twigs to mimic a forest floor.\n\nMoss Terrariums: As we know that moss thrives in moist, lit environments, \nit should come as no surprise that moss terrariums are a perfect way to add moss to your home. \nAll you need to do is choose a glass container of your liking and place in it moss, stones, water, and any other features that you think would look beautiful. \nThen, make sure it gets enough light (typically achieved by using a type of indoor grow light) and you’re off to the races.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nMoss Paint: Because moss is so versatile, it can be turned into a “paint” of sorts and \napplied to walls. This process is known as making “eco-graffiti” and is easier than it looks.\n\nAll you’ll need is:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tA clump or two of moss\n\t\t\t2 cups of buttermilk\n\t\t\t2 cups of water\n\t\t\t½ tsp of sugar\n\t\t\n\n\nOnce you gather these ingredients, blend them all together until the consistency is similar to paint. \nThen, simply apply it to walls in whatever design you desire. You can get creative here – \nuse stencils, write words, or draw animals. You’re only limited by your imagination.\n\nAll in all, moss is an underrated plant that deserves a place in your garden, whether you add it indoors or outdoors. \nWith these ideas and care instructions, you have more than enough information to get started with a beautiful moss garden.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYKEVIN ESPIRITU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Espiritu runs the gardening site Epicgardening.com, where he aims to demystify the secrets of the green thumb.

In this case, think about sleeping, feeding, playing, changing diapers and clothes and so on. \nAsk yourself what you will be doing the most often. If you lack space, consider placing furniture not only against the walls, but in the corners as well.\n\nOptimal spacing and safety are important considerations when locating key pieces of furniture for a comfortable and convenient nursery. \nOne of the focal pieces (and most used pieces) of furniture is the crib. After rocking or feeding the baby, \nthe transition to the crib should be as smooth as possible. Keep a small nightstand or side table near the rocker and place a dim lamp on it. \nThis item can be ideal for bedtime books and empty bottles after feedings. A small drawer in the nightstand can hold easy-to-reach cold tablets or burp cloths when needed. \nYou also want to keep the crib away from the door so that when you peek in to check on the baby, you don’t wake him or her. \nLastly, the crib should be located away from a drafty window and away from curtains and draperies where the baby can easily reach, to avoid choking or other hazards. \nThe glider can be placed near the window so mom can look out while feeding.\n \nAnother key piece of furniture is the changing table. When changing the baby, diapers, wipes, \nand a fresh clean outfit should be easily accessible without having to walk away and leave the baby. \nThe changing table should be close to the dresser so you can easily and quickly grab an outfit. \nKeep the diaper pail and hamper near the changing table as well. This way you can discard the diaper and dirty clothes without leaving the baby’s side.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOrganizing a Dresser and Changing Station\n\nThere never seems to be enough storage for all the baby’s necessities, and traditional closets with just a standard bar to hang clothes are often not cut out for efficient use. \nGet creative by placing a small shelf inside a closet if you lack a closet system. \nPlace a tension rod in the middle of a bookshelf and remove lower shelves for hanging clothes. \nLack closet drawers? You can use baskets or crates for accessories, extra diapers, or books and toys. \nYou can also use a shoe organizer on the back of a closet door for hats and accessories. \nChances are that you have purchased clothing that the baby doesn’t quite fit into yet. Organize these clothes by month with clothing dividers.\n\nDo you still need more storage? Cubed shelving with bins is a great solution. A large cubed shelving unit creates extra storage and shelving, \nwhile a small unit provides a table top for baby’s things. Bins can hold everything from extra diapers to toys and keep them out of sight. \nThey are also transitional and versatile for when the baby becomes a toddler. \nBins can be removed and cubes can be used as shelves for books, piggy banks, and decorative items.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDouble Duty Decorating\n\nNow that the furniture is placed properly, it’s time to decorate. \nFraming favorite nursery books or pages with illustrations makes simple DIY artwork. \nOf course, baby’s name or monogram is a must and adds a personal touch as well. \nYou can also add your own style with a rug and wall decals. \nBut decorating with double duty in mind is a great way to combine fashion and function. \nUse picture ledges on a wall to hold and display books. \nA row of fabric-lined wicker or wire baskets can be hung on a wall vertically or horizontally for attractive toy storage. \nA vintage ladder against a wall can display baby blankets and quilts.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDon’t forget about shades and curtains. Not only should they reflect your style and color scheme, they should also be easy to draw for naptime and bedtime. \nBlack- out shades, liners, or roman shades work well in a nursery. You can anchor them with decorative curtains, satisfying both beauty and function.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot to think about when preparing a nursery for your little one. From proper furniture placement and drawer organization, \ncloset set-up to double-duty decorating, the best thing to keep in mind is that if it doesn’t work, change it. \nAfter about a dozen diaper changes or so, you will be able to make slight changes to best fit the needs of both you and your baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYDINAH WULF\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDinah is an expert in all things DIY.

When it comes to human food and survival, \npollinators such as bees, butterflies, wasps, flies, bats, hummingbirds, and so forth can be called true heroes. \nAfter all, pollinated flowers produce food: fruit, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. In addition, the seeds hold the future for those plant species.\n\nNatural Pollinators and Our Food\n\nSo exactly how important are pollinators? Well, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, \nabout thirty-five percent of the entire world’s food crops depend on insects and animals, \nand three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants rely on natural pollinators for their very survival. That makes pollinators extremely important.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTips for Attracting Pollinators to the Garden\n\nSo how do we get these insects and animals to show up and do what they do best? \nWe can plant gardens and simply hope that pollinators crash the party, which can and does work (some of the time).\n\nBut we can also send out an engraved invitation and let them know that they are at the top of the guest list for our yards and gardens. \nThere are many ways to set a welcoming stage for natural pollinators:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tStagger the Blooms. Pollinators show up at various times of the season, so the ideal plan would be to have plants blooming at various intervals all season long, \n\t\t\tfor example, in early spring, mid- to late spring, early summer, mid- to late summer, early fall, and mid- to late fall (depending on your region).\n\t\t\tCreate a Diverse Habitat by planting a wide assortment of nectar- and pollen-rich plants. Blossoms with various colors and shapes present a veritable smorgasbord. \n\t\t\tInclude pollen-laden, old-fashioned flowers and wildflowers. Be generous with food sources, and plant as many as possible. \n\t\t\tIt’s easier for pollinators to spot large displays of flowers than a random blossom here and there.\n\t\t\tGive Their Kids a Home. They might show up for the food, but they’ll stay for their kids. Consider providing food sources for caterpillars (baby butterflies). \n\t\t\tResearch the species that live in your area and plant for a baby caterpillar’s appetite. \n\t\t\tFor example, monarch caterpillars need milkweed and black swallowtail caterpillars love fennel. Bats will take up residence in a bat house, \n\t\t\tand blue mason bees will raise their young inside a wooden block or stump with pre-drilled holes (of the correct size).\n\t\t\tProvide a Water Source. Most of your pollinating friends will need a water source. A birdbath that has some small rocks or a small pile of sticks in it is ideal. \n\t\t\tSmall critters such as bees and butterflies need help to keep from drowning as they drink. \n\t\t\tButterflies will also enjoy a few mud puddles around for some “puddling” time. Butterflies enjoy alighting next to mud puddles and sucking up the minerals and nutrients.\n\t\t\n\n\nHoney Bees vs. Native Bees\n\nBoth honey and native bees have their human fan base in the gardening world. However, the truth is that they emerge at different times and they each specialize in specific plants. \nNone of these bees compete with each other for available pollen resources. Rather, these industrious critters work in tandem to pollinate the plants in our world.\n\nThe following is a list of honey bee and native bee facts.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe don’t have native honeybees in North America. Honeybees that we keep in hives for honey production are all imported from Europe.\n\t\t\tHoneybees are the only insects that produce food eaten by humans.\n\t\t\tHoney is the only food that includes all the substances necessary to sustain life, including enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and water.\n\t\t\tThe honeybees’ sense of smell is so precise that they can tell the difference among hundreds of flower varieties, as well as which flowers carry nectar and which carry pollen, from meters away.\n\t\t\tThere are approximately 2,000 to 6,000 bees in in a single colony – plus one queen.\n\t\t\tFemale worker bees work for the entire six weeks of their lives, while the queen lives up to five years and lays up to 2,500 eggs a day.\n\t\t\tMale honeybees (called drones) have only one job: to breed. They die soon after inseminating a queen, as their abdomens are ripped from their bodies because they are still connected to the queen. \n\t\t\tSurviving drones (which have not yet bred) are driven from the hive during extreme winters if food become scarce.\n\t\t\n\n\nInformation on native bees:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThere are 4,000 native bee species in the United States.\n\t\t\tMost of our native bees are solitary bees and don’t live in hives.\n\t\t\tSome native bees fly in cooler weather. Therefore, they visit flowers earlier in the season and are more likely to pollinate early-blooming fruit trees.\n\t\t\tNative bees (and other insects and animals) do most of the pollinating. Honeybees supplement the pollinating work of the native pollinators.\n\t\t\tLike a mother hen, a queen bumblebee incubates her eggs while sitting in a little nest of straw. Her abdomen controls the egg temperature, which speeds up the development of her larvae. \n\t\t\tEven after they have hatched, the queen will keep her daughters warm until they are old enough to leave and forage for food on their own.\n\t\t\tThe native blue mason (orchard) bee is a solitary bee that has no hive or honey to defend. Therefore, they are quite non-aggressive and gentle. \n\t\t\tOnly the female has a stinger, and it’s rare for her to use it. Her “stinger” is an egg tube and holds no venom to inject.\n\t\t\tBumblebees live in small colonies (compared to honeybees) of between 50 and 500 bees. They usually make their home underground in holes that have been abandoned by the rodents that originally made them.\n\t\t\n\n\nPlants Pollinators Can’t Resist\n\nThe fact that flowers fascinate, delight, and amaze us humans is, quite frankly, a happy coincidence. \nFrom a plant’s point of view, flowers are a functional vehicle for reproduction. \nThey have had millions of years to perfect their individual seductive flower style and pollinators are attracted to a variety of flower structures depending on the species. \nPlanting a mixture of annual and perennial plants can help provide a diverse assortment of blossoms.\n\nFor example, a wide assortment of bees (honey and native species) are attracted to flat-and \nopen flowers with easy access to the pollen, such as Queen Anne’s lace, zinnias, daisies, and asters. \nMonarda, larkspur, lavender, salvia, mint, and oregano will attract long-tongued bees and hummingbirds. \nBe sure to add some native plants to your pollinator garden. They are important to the survival of your regional native pollinator species.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPerennial Plant List for Pollinators\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAllium\n\t\t\tAster\n\t\t\tBee balm\n\t\t\tBlanket flower (annual and perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tBlazing star\n\t\t\tBorage (annual and perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tButterfly bush\n\t\t\tCalendula\n\t\t\tCoreopsis (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tCosmos (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tDaylily\n\t\t\tDelphinium\n\t\t\tDianthus (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tDill\n\t\t\tFennel\n\t\t\tFlax (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tFour o'clock\n\t\t\tGaillardia\n\t\t\tGeranium\n\t\t\tGiant hyssop\n\t\t\tGlobe thistle\n\t\t\tGoldenrod\n\t\t\tHollyhock (biennial)\n\t\t\tHyssop\n\t\t\tJoe-pye weed\n\t\t\tLavender\n\t\t\tLovage\n\t\t\tLupine (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tMarjoram (tender perennial)\n\t\t\tMint\n\t\t\tMullein\n\t\t\tMusk mallow\n\t\t\tNasturtium\n\t\t\tOregano\n\t\t\tPaint brush (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tPhlox\n\t\t\tPoppy (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tPurple coneflower\n\t\t\tRosemary\n\t\t\tRudbeckia\n\t\t\tSage\n\t\t\tScabiosa (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tShasta daisy\n\t\t\tSkullcap\n\t\t\tStonecrop\n\t\t\tSunflower (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tSweet Cicely\n\t\t\tTansy\n\t\t\tThyme\n\t\t\tVerbena\n\t\t\tWallflower (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tWild rose\n\t\t\tYarrow\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Plant List for Pollinators\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCoreopsis (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tCosmos (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tDill\n\t\t\tMarigold\n\t\t\tQueen Anne's lace\n\t\t\tAlyssum (long-blooming annual)\n\t\t\tBasil\n\t\t\tBlanket flower (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tBorage (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tDianthus (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tFlax (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tLupine (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tPaint brush (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tPoppy (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n            Scabiosa (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tSunflower (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tWallflower (annual or perennial depending on variety)\n\t\t\tZinnia\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nAttracting natural pollinators to your yard and garden is especially helpful in urban and suburban areas where diverse plant species have been displaced by city buildings and homes. \nA garden with a diverse environment will keep pollinators happy and at home.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCHRIS MCLAUGHLIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris is a Northern Californian gardening expert, with over 35 years of experience in the soil.

Stress can have many negative effects on physical and psychological systems. \nAn inability to positively control or manage stress may lead to inappropriate behavior such as alcohol consumption, overeating, or neglecting feelings. \nIt’s important to know that stress can be managed effectively, at very little cost, and in a fun way! \nArt therapy is a great therapeutic approach that you can use in your daily life to keep your stress levels low and your contentedness high.\n\nWhat is Art Therapy?\n\nArt therapy is an approach that involves the creative processes of art to improve one’s life. \nFor example, drawing, coloring, painting, doodling, and sculpting are all examples of art forms that can be used as a means of therapy. \nUsing art as a medium for healing promotes self-exploration, understanding, self-esteem, and awareness. \nIt is a way for a person to improve their mental, emotional, and physical states, as well as their overall health. \nWhen you use imagery, colors, shapes, and designs as a part of your therapeutic process, \nyour thoughts and feelings can be expressed through your art, rather than words that are often difficult to articulate to others. \nThis means that you do not have to verbalize how you are feeling.\n\nArt therapy can be done in counseling, where you work one-on-one with a trained and certified art therapist. \nHowever, the healing potential of art is not only effective in a counseling or psychotherapy setting. \nArt therapy techniques and approaches can be completed at home, work, or school without a therapist. \nIn some methods of art therapy, you are your own therapist.\n\nThis is one of the great things about art therapy – you can practice antistress art anywhere! \nArt can be practiced at work, at home, on the bus, or during any downtime. \nRather than stressing out about the next big meeting, you can color or doodle on some paper. \nYou can release negative emotions about your job or personal relationships through artwork. \nThis, in turn, helps overcome the stress, avoids further upset and creates a coping strategy for future stressful times.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWho Can Benefit from Art Therapy?\n\nYou don’t need to be a talented artist to engage in art therapy or to enjoy its benefits. \nAfter all, the goal is not to create a masterpiece but to express yourself freely through art; the artistic results are secondary to the emotional benefits. \nArt therapy improves the lives of many people. It can help people who have been exposed to loss or trauma. \nIt can support people in overcoming addiction and mental health disorders. \nIt has even been used in hospital settings for cancer patients. It’s also a common expressive therapy for children. \nThe great thing about art therapy is that it can help the lives of so many people – even if you do not have a major concern or illness. \nArt therapy is beneficial to people who experience the stressors of everyday modern life.\n\nHave you ever noticed how expressive arts therapy is calming and peaceful? Have you ever come home from a long work day in front of the computer and needed an outlet that wasn’t a screen? \nEngaging in art techniques can clear the mind, let us put feelings and thoughts onto paper or canvas, and leave us feeling accomplished and calm. \nIt is a great option for people who experience even minor stress or upset in their lives.\n\nYour Brain on Art\n\nWhen we engage in the creation of our own art forms, we receive big benefits to our minds, both physically and mentally. \nWhen we produce art with our own hands, there is increased neural connectivity in the area of the brain that deals with introspection, memory, and self-monitoring. \nThis means that this area is more active when engaged in producing art. \nMentally, we become more psychologically resilient, we have increased positive perspectives, and become more self-aware. \nThis makes us better at coping with future problems, stressors, or events. \nIt is said that the pairing of actually creating the art (motor processing) and thinking about expression (cognitive processing) is what makes art therapy so beneficial.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTypes of Art Therapy for Different Feelings and Emotions\n\nTo do art therapy, you can either take a nondirected or directed approach. A nondirected approach is flexible, and less structured than a directed approach. \nFor example, you would draw, paint, color, or sculpt without guidelines. \nA directed approach is more structured in the sense that you choose an art therapy activity that relates to certain feelings and emotions. \nWith either approach, your feelings are expressed, and your stress levels decrease. The benefits of art therapy are provided in both approaches. \nHere are some examples of art therapy activities related to feelings and emotions that you can try:\n\nEmotions:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPaint or draw your emotions. Here, you want to think about how you are feeling and put that feeling into paper, however you see it.\n\t\t\tCreate an emotion wheel. You’ll want to use lots of color for this activity! Label each emotion with a color that fits for you.\n\t\t\tDesign a postcard that you will never send. This activity helps with releasing anger in a way that never has to be presented to someone else.\n\t\t\tColoring books for emotions. You can buy, or print, certain coloring pages that were created to release emotions.\n\t\t\n\n\nHappiness\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMake a collage related to a quote that speaks to you. Turn words that mean a lot to you and turn it into a visual that is inspiring.\n\t\t\tDraw a wild invention. This activity will get your creative juices flowing and will most likely be wild and funny!\n\t\t\tDraw animals you love. For some people, animals are a source of love and happiness. Draw the ones that you love the most (your own pet included).\n\t\t\tDraw, color, or paint your idea of the perfect day or perfect home. This activity will help you create a visual of spaces and things that feel safe and warm to you.\n\t\t\n\n\nRelaxation\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPaint or color while listening to music. When art and music are paired together, our brains and bodies can relax.\n\t\t\tMake a mandala. You can either print one off or draw your own – this is a meditative symbol that is relaxing to look at and work with.\n\t\t\tDraw something very big! Get out the large pieces of paper or a big cardboard box and get your body moving.\n\t\t\tChoose colors that are relaxing and calming to you and only use those. Sometimes certain colors elicit different feelings for us. Choose ones that speak to you.\n\t\t\tDraw, paint, or sculpt outdoors. The sights, sounds, and atmosphere of the outdoors, when paired with art, are very relaxing.\n\t\t\n\n\nTrauma and Loss\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCreate a collage of your worries. Put whatever worries you in your life on paper.\n\t\t\tTurn illness into a masterpiece. If you or someone close to you is ill, turn those feelings into something meaningful.\n\t\t\tPaint someone you have lost. If you have lost someone close to you, remember him or her and make that special person close to you again.\n\t\t\tDraw a safe space. You can refer to your safe space when you need a reminder.\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOther Types of Art Therapy\n\nArt therapy is available in adult coloring books that are affordable, easy, and even portable. It would be best to go look at these books and take a peek inside. \nThink about which ones elicit different feelings, and choose one that speaks to you and how you are feeling or what you are going through.\n\nAnother form of art therapy is paint nights. This type of art therapy is done in a group setting and often held at local restaurants and bars. \nYou go with friends and sit with other people who are all painting the same picture. \nIn the end, you see how everyone painted the same picture differently. \nYou can also host your own paint night by gathering up some friends or family and purchasing some paint and canvas. \nYou can designate a specific picture for everyone to draw, or you can leave it up to the group! \nArt therapy in a group allows for free expression in an environment that is safe and accepting.\n\nArt therapy is an easy, affordable, and beneficial way to express feelings, reduce stress, and remind us of the happy things. \nWe are able to put difficult feelings into something visual and meaningful. \nWhen we draw, color, or paint, our brains become active and are better at helping us out with any future stressors.\n\nAlthough art therapy can be beneficial to pursue individually in the comfort of your own home, it is important to also consider the support from a certified art therapist in your area. Sometimes, engaging in art therapy techniques can bring about strong emotions, past trauma, or confusing thoughts. A certified art therapist can be the external support necessary in managing these feelings. If you would like support from an art therapist, please search for one in your area.\n\n\n            100 Art Therapy Exercises\n\t\t\tCanadianTherapy.org\n\t\t\t100 Art Journal Exercises\n\t\t\thttp://intuitivecreativity.typepad.com/expressiveartinspirations/100-art-therapy-exercises.html\n\t\t\tBenefits of Art Therapy\n\t\t\tThe Impact of Art on Your Brain\n\t\t\tHow Art Changes The Brain\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYCAILEIGH FLANNIGAN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCaileigh is a play practitioner who uses forms of play such as exploring the outdoors and experimenting with loose parts as a way to promote children’s development and emotional healing.

Yeah, we know, we’re party poopers, but we’re trying to help you out, here.\n\nWhile a cork-turned-flying-projectile is admittedly kind of fun, \nthere are better ways of ensuring that your celebrations include getting the best out of the bottles of bubbly on which you spent your hard-earned cash. \nThose start with knowing the best way for chilling your sparkling wine (hint: it involves salt), \nand the best way to open it once it’s cooled down (hint: it’s not supposed to be noisy).\n\nHere’s a primer on chilling and opening your bubbles, with an overview of the science behind it, \nfor those of you who are skeptics at heart, and in case you want to impress your friends with your wine knowledge.\n\nChilling it Out\n\nDue to its carbonation, sparkling wine generally tastes best when it’s served colder than most other wine styles. \nTypically, this is in the 43–48 degrees F (6–7 degrees C) temperature range. \nA lower temperature also slows down the molecular activity in the bottle, making it safer to open; warmer carbonated liquid tends to foam up more – which can make a mess. \nSo, in a way, chilling sparkling wine is actually the first step in properly opening it.\n\nYou can achieve this chill-down by putting your bubbles into the refrigerator, but that takes about three hours, \nand mostly kills the romance associated with whipping out a bottle of celebratory sparkling wine. \nThe quickest way to get your sparkling wine to the right serving temperature – \nusually getting the trick done on a 750 ml bottle in 20 minutes or less – is by using an ice bucket, ice, water, and salt.\n\nFirst, fill the ice bucket about halfway with ice and water. This is the most important step in chilling the wine, and the one that even some seasoned professionals sometimes miss. \nA mixture of ice and water will chill down your sparkling wine much more quickly than ice alone. \nFor that, we can thank the laws of thermodynamics (you know, the stuff you slept through during science class in high school). \nFor the wine to cool, it needs to transfer its heat to its surroundings; the colder the surroundings, the more quickly it can do this. \nIce, of course, cools the area around the bottle, but ice alone will have many air pockets between the ice cubes, and air, being a gas, isn’t great at heat/energy transfer. \nWater, on the other hand, is a pretty good medium for transferring heat, and it will fill in the air pockets between the ice cubes, \nincreasing the amount of cooling material in contact with the bottle, thereby getting the bottle of bubbles cooler, faster.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nAdding a handful of salt to the ice/water mixture before gently putting the bottle into the ice bucket is also a good idea. \nWhy? Because salt will lower the freezing temperature of the ice water in the bucket. \nWhen that happens, there’s more melting than freezing happening in the bucket, increasing the ice water’s ability to absorb energy from the wine bottle, \nand minimizing the cooling time required. See, you should have paid more attention in physics class!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nDon’t “Pop” it Open\n\nNow that you’ve given your sparkling wine a 15-or-so minute chill-out, it’s time to open it up. Notice we didn’t say “pop” it open. \nFlying corks can be dangerous, and should be avoided. \nNot only that, but a loud “pop!” indicates that you’re releasing a lot of the carbonation in the sparkling wine, \nand you actually paid extra for those bubbles – so we want to keep them inside the bottle as best we can. \nAlso, forget using a corkscrew on sparkling wine, because that’s dangerous; this needs to be done by hand.\n\nFirst, get a small towel and dry off your bottle after removing it from the ice bucket. \nNext, remove the foil around the top of the bottle, and grab the bottle with one hand. \nUsing your other hand, grab the wire tab at the bottom of the “cage” that secures the cork, and untwist it by turning it counter-clockwise.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhile doing this, keep a thumb from your other hand on the top of the cage, \nand be sure that you’re not pointing the bottle at anyone (including yourself) or anything expensive. \nThe reason: you’re holding a potential missile. There are 5 to 6 atmospheres of pressure inside that corked bottle of bubbly, equating to about 70 and 90 pounds per square inch. \nThat’s the reason that Champagne bottles are thicker than still-wine bottles: so that they don’t explode. \nThe pressure is going to want to find the quickest release, which is the opening in the neck of the bottle.\n\nOnce the wire cage is loosened, put the small towel over the top of the bottle, \nhold it at about a 45° angle, and continue to hold the top with one hand. \nStart twisting the bottle – yes, the bottle – slowly with one hand, while applying pressure against the cork and cage with the hand that’s holding the towel-covered top of the bottle. \nThe carbonation will be trying to pop that cork right out, but that’s not what we want. \nContinue applying slight “negative” pressure as you twist the bottle, until the cork loosens and you can release it slowly.\n\nIf done correctly, instead of a pop, you should hear a sigh…which, hopefully, \nis similar to the sound that you’ll be making after drinking and appreciating your properly chilled and properly opened bottle of bubbles!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYJOE ROBERTS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoe Roberts is a certified wine specialist, and was named the 14th Most Influential People in the U.S. Wine Industry by IntoWine.com in 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoe Roberts's Author Profile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON February 15, 2017\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSave\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpice Up Your Coffee:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNothing beats the convenience of adding a shot of cream that also sweetens ...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSave\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tButternut Squash Is the New Pumpkin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTry making butternut squash pie this Thanksgiving!

Indian Sweet Jackfruit Balls (by Paleo FlourishGoogle \"jackfruit\" – go on, give it a try – and you will see something that looks like a science experiment gone wrong. This giant, bulbous mass is, believe it or not, a real fruit. It even grows on trees. Don’t ask me how. There’s been a lot of buzz about jackfruit recently so here is your complete guide to this tropical fruit, why it’s so popular, and how you can eat it and cook it at home. \n\nJackfruit 101: What is it, Where is it From, and Where Can I Buy it?\n\n\nJackfruit is the biggest fruit in the world. The world’s heaviest jackfruit according to Guinness came from India, clocking in at 42.72 kilograms (yes you read that right), was 57.15 centimeters long and had a circumference of 132.08 centimeters. But believe it or not the jackfruit tree is actually from the same family as a fig tree. I’m not making this up, I swear.\nSaveEmbed Image\nJackfruit is a common fruit in India, Southeast Asia, and the Philippines. It’s also grown in central and eastern Africa, and is popular in Surinam and Brazil. It turns from light green to yellow as it ripens and aside from its giant size is quite distinctive with its nubby blunt spiked texture.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\nYou can buy jackfruit in cans at many specialty grocery stores and supermarkets, or whole at Asian food markets. I’d recommend opting for the canned versions which are easier to handle when preparing recipes. You can find jackfruit canned in water (great for savory recipes) and syrup (for desserts).\n\nRipe vs Unripe Jackfruit\n\n\nRipe jackfruit is very different from unripe jackfruit. It’s actually the unripe jackfruit that is used in most recipes, and that’s what you’ll find on store shelves. The young, green, unripe jackfruit is chewy and mild, making it perfect for soaking up the flavor of the savory dishes you’re cooking. You can use a riper version for sweet dishes like desserts. In its ripe version, it’s typically too sweet to use in savory dishes.\nSaveEmbed Image\nWhy Has Jackfruit Become Such a Hot Topic?\n\n\nJackfruit is the fruit of the moment in the vegan community. It’s sort of like the best answer to meat you can get. The texture is substantial, very similar to pulled pork and the flesh of the fruit is very good at soaking up whatever flavors you marinate it with. Many vegans choose it over meat substitutes like tofu or soy- or bean-based products, and things like Portobello burgers. It’s a versatile ingredient that works in many different recipes. It’s just really good in the texture department, and until we figure out how to grow meat (stay tuned – that’s happening) this fruit tops the vegan-friendly list.\n\nResearchers even claim that jackfruit could be an answer to the world’s food security problems. Because it’s packed full of nutrients (potassium, calcium, iron) and calories, grows well in warmer climates, is robust against pests, disease, and drought, it could serve as an answer to dwindling yields of the crops we rely on most today like wheat and corn.\n\nIrresistible Jackfruit Recipes\n\n1. BBQ Jackfruit Sandwiches with Avocado Slaw (by Minimalist Baker)\n\nIngredients:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2 20-oz cans young green jackfruit in water (not syrup or brine)\n\t\t\t¼ cup BBQ seasoning (2 tbsps brown sugar, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp pepper, ½ tsp chili powder)\n\t\t\t1-2 tbsps olive oil\n\t\t\t¾ cup BBQ sauce + more for topping\n\t\t\t2 cups shredded carrots and cabbage\n\t\t\t½ ripe avocado\n\t\t\t1 tbsp maple syrup\n\t\t\t1 lime, juiced\n\t\t\tsalt and pepper to taste\n\t\t\t4-6 whole grain buns\n\t\t\t½ cup roasted salted cashews\n\t\t\n\t\n\nInstructions:\n1.\tRinse, drain and dry jackfruit.

Jackfruit “Crab” Cakes (by Veganosity)\n\nIngredients:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2 17-oz cans of jackfruit in water – rinsed, drained and patted dry, chopped until it resembles lump crab meat\n\t\t\t2 tbsps ground flax seed + 6 tbsps water – mix well and let sit for 10 mins\n\t\t\t1 tsp mustard powder + 1 tsp water – mix well\n\t\t\t2 tbsps + 1 tsp of Old Bay spice\n\t\t\t1 tsp Worcestershire sauce\n\t\t\t2 cloves garlic, minced\n\t\t\t1 tbsp lemon juice\n\t\t\t1 tsp salt, ½ tsp pepper\n\t\t\t3 tbsps chives, finely chopped\n\t\t\t¼ cup cilantro, finely chopped\n\t\t\t½ cup classic breadcrumbs + ½ cup panko breadcrumbs\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nInstructions:\n1.\tPut the mustard mixture, Old Bay spice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and lemon juice in a large bowl and whisk together until completely combined.\n2.\tAdd the jackfruit, flax mixture, salt, pepper, chives, cilantro, and both kinds of breadcrumbs. Combine with your hands until the mixture begins to stick together. Form into little cakes about 1 inch thick. Place the cakes on a plate and refrigerate for at least an hour.\n3.\tPreheat the oven to 375°F and put the cakes on parchment paper lining a cookie sheet. Squeeze lemon juice over the top of the cakes and bake for approx 10 mins or until golden brown. Flip and squeeze lemon juice on the top of the cakes and bake until golden brown and firm to the touch.\n4.\tCover the bottom of a large skillet with a thin layer of oil (1-2 tbsps) and heat on medium-high. When the oil is spitting hot add the cakes and cook until golden brown (approx 5 mins). Flip and cook until golden brown and firm to the touch.\n5.\tServe with aioli or sriracha and a lemon wedge. You could also serve these with the avocado slaw from recipe 1.\n\n3. Indian Sweet Jackfruit Balls (by Paleo Flourish)\n\nIngredients:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t½ lb (250 g) sweet jackfruit segments (you can buy jackfruit canned in syrup)\n\t\t\t2 tbsps honey\n\t\t\t1/3 cup coconut flour\n\t\t\t¼ tsp salt\n\t\t\t½ tbsp + 4 tbsps coconut oil\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nInstructions:\n1.\tPlace the sweet jackfruit segments, honey, salt, and ½ tbsp of coconut oil into a blender and blend well.\n2.\tPlace the puree into a bowl and mix in the coconut flour. Form small balls from the dough. The mixture should make approx 9-12 balls.\n3.\tAdd the 4 tbsps of coconut oil to a frying pan and pan-fry the balls until golden brown. Use a spoon to move the balls around so that they're fried evenly on all sides.\n4.\tServe with honey drizzled on top.\n\nJackfruit is a pretty impressive fruit on all fronts: size, nutrition, texture, resilience as a crop, and versatility in cooking. It may even come to replace the world’s biggest staples like wheat and corn.

It gets even better when delicious creamers are added to the mix. \nThey are perfect for savoring seasonal flavors while lightening up your java. \nBut when store-bought creamers boast a full roster of mysterious ingredients, you might be wondering if there is a healthier option.\n\nThis is where homemade coffee creamer recipes come in. By making your own, you can have full control over the ingredients. \nMoreover, you can adjust the flavors to fit your preferences and dietary restrictions. \nAnd with dairy-free foods becoming increasingly popular, it is worth checking out the list of nontraditional possibilities. \nTo top it off, homemade coffee creamers are budget-friendly, healthy, and easy to make. Read on to learn how to do it yourself.\n\nAll About Nondairy Milks\n\nIn recent years, nondairy milks have become the highlight of the food industry. This surge in popularity is a result of increased consumer knowledge across several areas. \nPeople are learning more about the dairy industry and traditional production practices. Additionally, the health benefits of no-dairy alternatives have garnered significant attention. \nConsumers are embracing different types of diets, lifestyles, and preferences. \nMany are also acknowledging the prevalence of lactose intolerance, a condition impacting more than 65 percent of the world’s human population. Read more about lactose intolerance statistics.\nSome individuals are allergic to dairy or simply do not like the taste. Thus, the industry has begun to focus on milks created from sources other than mammals.\n\nCurrently, the most popular nondairy options are soy, coconut, and almond milk. \nMany cafés and restaurants keep these options in stock. Other versions include cashew, rice, and pea protein milk. \nUnsurprisingly, these nondairy milks taste different from traditional cow’s milk. \nEach has a distinctive flavor that may take some getting used to. The consistency and color may also differ. \nAnd since these alternatives are specialty milks, the price points are often a bit higher. \nHowever, for most consumers, this is a decent trade-off for the nutritional value and dietary accommodations. \nIt also makes it easier to enjoy foods that typically call for dairy – examples include oatmeal and milkshakes. \nAnd if you’re a coffee drinker, you’ll be happy to know that flavored creamers can also be made in the same way with nondairy milks.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nHow to Make Homemade Coffee Creamers\n\nStore-bought creamers might be inexpensive, but they come with a price that doesn’t have to do with money. \nOften, they are full of preservatives, processed sugars, and sodium. \nCommercial creamers are typically dyed with artificial coloring; flavoring from real ingredients is seldom used. Luckily, you can make coffee creamer right in your own kitchen.\n\nHow To:\n\nOver medium heat, combine 2 cups nondairy milk and 2-4 teaspoons of brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup in a stainless-steel pot. \nFeel free to adjust the amount of sweetener per your preference. \nContinue stirring until the liquid is uniform. Keep a close eye on the creamer to make sure it doesn’t boil. \nIf you are making a flavored variation, simply mix in the additional ingredients indicated by the recipe.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nCinnamon Vanilla Creamer\n\nThis simple version brings together two classic favorites. The finished product will offer a medley of warm and cozy flavors that complement the best notes of coffee.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t½ teaspoon cinnamon\n\t\t\t1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\t\t\n\n\nPumpkin Pie Creamer\n\nEmbrace the best of autumn with this pumpkin pie version. \nThis is a perfect quick fix when you’re craving a pumpkin spice latte. \nIf you want to use the freshest ingredients possible, swap out the canned pumpkin with fresh butternut squash puree. \nThe flavor is practically identical.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2 tablespoons canned pumpkin puree\n\t\t\t½ teaspoon cinnamon\n\t\t\t½ teaspoon nutmeg\n\t\t\t½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice\n\t\t\t1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\t\t\n\n\nPeppermint Vanilla Creamer\n\nTake it up a notch with a generous dose of mint flavor. It’s an excellent way to create a holiday-inspired beverage on a chilly morning. \nTop it off with coconut whipped cream and dark chocolate flakes for a luscious treat.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1 tablespoon peppermint extract\n\t\t\t1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\t\t\n\n\nHazelnut Chocolate Creamer\n\nHazelnut is a classic creamer flavor that can be enjoyed all year round. You can also use almond extract instead of hazelnut for a slightly different taste.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t¼ cup dark chocolate chips\n\t\t\t1 tablespoon hazelnut extract\n\t\t\t½ tablespoon vanilla extract\n\t\t\n\n\nNontraditional Sweeteners\n\nIf your taste buds are craving more, you can add another sweetener. The traditional choice is white table sugar. \nThese days, however, cafés and restaurants cater to consumers’ need for alternative options. \nFor example, raw sugar is commonly available for people who want the most natural option possible. \nThis sugar is the most earth-friendly as it requires the least processing and chemicals. Brown sugar, which contains molasses, boasts a distinct flavor that some love. \nLow-calorie artificial sweeteners such as Splenda and Equal have also become increasingly common. \nAnd while there have been debates regarding the safety of these synthetic sugars, they are widely available at food establishments.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nClearly, there are many choices out there. But when you are making a homemade coffee creamer, it’s likely that you also care about your sweetener of choice. \nIf you want to leave room for experimentation, prepare your creamer with less sweetener than the recipe calls for. This way, you will have the space to adjust the taste with each cup.\n\nKeep it simple with all-natural alternatives. Honey is simple, healthy, and tasty. Buy local honey whenever possible; it’s an easy way to support local beekeepers.\n\nAgave nectar is sweeter than honey and doubles as an excellent option for vegans. \nMolasses does not have as many calories as white sugar and offers a distinctive taste that is adored by many. \nYou can even opt for dairy-free butter made of olive or coconut oil. \nThis new substitute has stolen the spotlight as a healthy choice that creates a creamy, luscious consistency. \nMaple syrup is another unique alternative. It is extremely high in sugar, however; it’s a good idea to use sparingly and mindfully.\n\nAs you can see, coffee offers ample room for customization. \nDon’t be afraid to play around with ingredients until you find a combination that works for your taste buds, preferences, and lifestyle. \nIt’s a delicious way to bring out the best in every cup of coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYKIRSTEN NUNEZ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKirsten Nunez is a lifestyle author based out of New York.

Here are some tips and tricks for staying warm and dry when the weather just won't cooperate.\n\nStay Dry\n\nThe first line of defense in a rainstorm is rain gear. No matter what the weather forecast says, don’t head out the door without a waterproof jacket in your pack. \nThere are a lot of options to consider when purchasing a rain jacket or rain pants, including cost, weight, durability, and material.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStay Warm\n\nWhether you expect it to rain or not, the most important thing to look for in outdoor clothing is that it contains no cotton. \nWhen cotton gets wet, it holds the moisture close to your skin and actually sucks heat away from your body. \nThere are a number of synthetic fabrics, like polypropylene and synthetic fleece (pile), that are designed to wick moisture away from your skin, which helps your body stay warm. \nWool, which is a popular natural option, also stays very warm when wet.\n\nWhile backpacking in the rain, the goal is to stay warm and dry, but if you have to pick one or the other on the trail, it’s usually enough to just stay warm. \nDuring a short storm, a rain jacket or hard shell and synthetic hiking pants will serve you well. The rain jacket keeps your core dry and, therefore, warm. \nThe pants may get wet, but the heat from your body will dry them out as you hike. In warm weather, it's often overkill to wear rain pants, which don't breathe as well as hiking pants. \nIn a deluge or very cold rain, it's usually time to break out the rain pants. If it's really cold and rainy, add a layer under the rain jacket, but try to avoid wearing your warmest layer. \nIf you wear everything you have and the rain jacket stops keeping out water, you suddenly have no dry layers to change into when you stop moving and your body begins to cool down.\n\nA light hat under the hood of a rain jacket can go a long way toward keeping your body warm in the rain, even if the hat gets wet. \nBe sure to keep your hood up even in light rain because it keeps the water from running down your neck and into your collar. \nKeep your sleeves inside the rain jacket and the rain jacket cuffs tight to prevent water from seeping up your arms. \nIn cold weather, layer rain pants over long underwear. \nIf you're wearing gaiters, be sure to keep the rain pants over the gaiter, or else the water will run down your legs and into your shoes.\n\nA common misconception is that a rain jacket can double as a windbreaker while hiking. \nRain jackets don't breathe quite as well as windbreakers because the fabric has to be tighter to keep the water out. \nTherefore, if you hike around in a rain jacket when it isn't raining, you'll often find yourself sweating more than you would in a different layer. \nSweat and overuse break down the waterproof material, meaning you can actually ruin a rain jacket by wearing it when you don't need to. \nSave the rain jacket for the rain and invest in a lightweight wind jacket for normal hiking. It's worth the extra weight.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf You Get Wet\n\nDon't panic if you get a little (or a lot) wet! \nIt's not the most pleasant way to spend a day, or a night, but if you have enough clothing to stay warm, the discomfort of a few wet layers won’t cause your demise. \nThe most important rule is to keep the dry things dry and the wet things wet, unless you can get them dry. \nA lot of people get to camp, set up, and immediately remove every wet layer, replacing it with their dry backups. \nThis is fine, unless you then put all the wet layers in a ball in the bottom of your pack. They will never dry balled up, and if the rain continues, they won't dry unless you warm them up with your body heat. \nAt some point, you will have to put the wet layers back on, a process that is much more palatable if the clothes have already had a chance to dry a little against your skin.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIf you arrive in camp completely drenched and the rain hasn't stopped, remove your outermost layers and put on something dry. \nIf you can comfortably leave a base layer on under a dry jacket, that's the best option as it will dry quickly. \nHowever, if you're miserably cold, trade all of the wet items for dry layers. Lay the wet layers flat under your sleep pad; \nthe compression of the layers when you sleep is more conducive for drying than leaving the layers balled up. \nIf the sun comes out, hang all of your wet layers in direct sunlight! If it looks like the storm has set in for a few days, \nit's crucial to always have a set of dry clothes for when you stop hiking. If you can't comfortably dry your wet layers overnight, \nbe sure to hike in them the next day and tuck the dry layers in a safe place in your pack. \nA common mistake is for people to soak all of their clothes because it's more comfortable to start the day in dry layers. \nThis is risky because it leaves you with no dry options if the weather stays bleak.\n\nIn Camp\n\nIf your body can stay warm enough, its heat will dry your wet layers. It does take some time and it's often uncomfortable, but it's definitely effective and worth the effort. \nFor long underwear layers (top and bottom) it won't take a lot of exercise or warmth for your body to turn a wet item into a damp item and eventually back into a dry piece of clothing. \nIf you sleep in something that's damp, it will often be dry in the morning. \nA good trick with socks is to wrap them around your stomach or, if they're really wet, place them under your sleeping bag. \nYour core generates a lot of heat, which helps speed the drying process.\n\nWaterproofing\n\nAt the end of a rainy trip, it's important to take care in cleaning your rain gear. After several uses, your rain jacket is probably ready to be re-waterproofed. \nThe DWR (durable water repellent) finish, which is applied to the outside of most rain jackets and hard shells, breaks down over time. \nWith a GORE-TEX jacket, simply throw it in the dryer, which will reactivate the finish. \nWith a normal rain jacket, it’s sometimes better to spray the jacket with a new coat of DWR, which you can buy at most outdoor retailers. \nSimply follow the directions for washing and drying your waterproof gear. It's not necessary to re-waterproof after every use, but after a handful of trips, it's probably time. \nYou'll know it's time when water no longer beads on the outside of the coat, but immediately permeates the first layer of the fabric. \nMaintaining your gear's waterproofing will ensure your rain gear has a long life and that your underlayers remain dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYALISON HUDSON\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlison Hudson is a field instructor for the National Outdoor Leadership School, where she imparts her outdoors knowledge of backcountry and frontcountry camping on students.

It may seem basic, something barely worth considering. \nHowever, having a goal can inform how you approach the sport you're getting back into, especially the tenacity with which you do so. \nIf your goal isn't to set a personal best, do you really need to be pushing quite that hard on the court? Young people often have high expectations of themselves when playing sports, \nwhich can impact an adult's perception of the activity when they try to get back into it. \nWinning and constantly improving may not be reasonable goals for an adult and can make it hard to enjoy re-entering a sport, because these expectations are often out of line with realistic goals. \nFor some people, the tenacity with which they practiced and played as a child make it difficult to enjoy a sport as an adult, \nbecause their body now has different limitations. Setting a goal helps keep things in perspective when a sport gets frustrating.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nStart Slowly\n\nWhen you go back to an old sport, start out slowly. Injury is one of the biggest risks to people starting a new sport or re-engaging in one they haven't played in years. \nDoing too much too fast is almost assuredly going to result in an injury, so start off slowly and don't try to tackle it all at once. If you're getting back into a team sport, \nconsider adding a few days of another activity, such as running or yoga, to your schedule to help your body get back into shape. \nStretching and yoga help your muscles limber up, increase flexibility, and help decrease the likelihood of injury. Give your body time to recover and adapt to the new routine.\n\nAs you get more involved in the sport, keep your expectations in check. Remember that record you set in high school? \nThe five-minute mile you ran in college? Don't compete with your younger self. \nThere are a lot of ways in which adult athletes perform better than they did in their youth, but it takes time and focus to develop those skills.\n\nIf it's been a long time since you played the sport or you've opted for trying something totally new, \nconsider taking a class or finding a trainer to help you get the most out of your re-entry into sports. \nAlways talk to your doctor before embarking on any new fitness regime.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTeam Sports\n\nWhen you're just rejoining a sport and haven't been especially active for a while, \nlook for recreational leagues that are based on having fun rather than on pure competition. \nSports should be fun, yet the stress of having to be great right out of the gate can be off-putting for some people. \nEnjoying the activity will give you time to improve your fitness level; \nyou can always move up to a more competitive league when you're ready for a bigger challenge.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who prefers to just get out for fun, look for a group that's like-minded. Many towns have recreation departments that host adult sports leagues. \nSome smaller towns host weekly sporting events for adults at the local high school; in larger urban centers, check out the Y or a gym to see if they offer adult sports.\n\nSome sports are easier to rejoin than others: pick-up basketball games are ubiquitous, as are masters swim leagues and running clubs. \nFor more complex sports such as hockey or fencing, finding a team can be a little more challenging, especially if you live in a rural area. \nDon't be afraid to look a bit further afield, and if you can't find a group to join, consider creating your own!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nIndividual Sports\n\nSolo sports such as skiing, running, or weightlifting are often the easiest to pick back up, \nbecause you don't have to find a team or a league. \nThe downside to these sports is that they can be lonely, especially if you're restarting and it's harder than you remembered. \nStaying engaged and committed can be difficult if you're always on your own. \nIf this is the case for you, there are often clubs you can join or gyms where you'll meet a workout partner.\n\nGear\n\nIf you've been out of a sport for a while, the amount of gear that seems necessary for participating can be daunting, even if it's just running: the right shoes, socks, shorts, and shirt, \nnot to mention the extra gear that goes with your specific sport! Depending on the sport, though, it's often unnecessary to invest in all the gear, never mind the fanciest, \nwhen you're first restarting. Wait a few months or a year to see how much you enjoy the activity before buying nicer stuff. Some sports such as fencing, hockey, \nand skiing do require a few unique items. See if you can buy some of the pricier items used from a sports shop, or attend a local gear swap. S\nome stores will rent expensive equipment such as skis and bikes on a day-to-day basis. \nThis can be an economical way to test your excitement about participating in a sport before you really commit. \nThe one thing to never skimp on is any safety gear that's used in your sport. This can be a big expense, but it's always worth the cost.\n\nFitness for adults, whether through organized team sports, specialized group exercise classes, or a personal challenge encouraged by a fitness tracker, is trending nationwide. \nSo, whether it's been a few years or a few decades since you last participated in a sport, there's no need to wait any longer to get back in the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYALISON HUDSON\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlison Hudson is a field instructor for the National Outdoor Leadership School, where she imparts her outdoors knowledge of backcountry and frontcountry camping on students.

It’s exactly why cafés are so popular these days. \nCoffee brings people together, whether it is for work or play. \nSome can’t even start their days without it! After all, this breakfast staple doubles as morning fuel. \nNo wonder it has a place in every restaurant menu. In fact, 54 percent of Americans over the age of 18 drink coffee every day. \nThe U.S. also spends $40 billion on coffee each year. Needless to say, coffee is loved by many.\n\nBut if you do not know much about it, ordering a cup can be intimidating. How does dark roast taste? What is in a macchiato? \nWhy is there foam on top? It is enough to make anyone’s head spin. You don’t have to panic order, though. \nTake some time to learn about the basics; it’s the best way to enjoy a cup of joe.\n\nWhat is Coffee?\n\nCoffee is a brewed caffeinated beverage. They are made from coffee beans – which are not actually beans at all! \nThese “beans” are the seeds of the berries from a coffee plant. They start out green, but turn brown when they are processed and roasted. \nThis makes them more aromatic, something coffee-lovers adore. Discover more about the journey of a coffee bean.\n\nSpecifically, dry heat is used to roast coffee beans. Different flavors and aromas can be achieved through different techniques. You can learn about various types of coffee beans here.\nOnce roasted, the beans are ground and ready to be brewed. At home, most people use an automatic coffee maker to make their coffee. \nBut more serious connoisseurs might use equipment like a French press or a pour-over coffee maker. \nHowever, a basic automatic version is all you need to enjoy a simple cup. You can also go to a café and have a barista do the fancy work for you.\n\nRoasted beans can be purchased whole or ground. Whole beans need to be ground, which can be done with a coffee grinder. \nAnd since coffee is freshest right after grinding, some people prefer doing this. Otherwise, pre-ground coffee can be brewed right out of the bag.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTypes of Roasts\n\nDepending on the type of roasting, coffee can vary in color, taste, and caffeine levels. There is something for everyone out there.\n\nLight Roast:\n\nBecause light roast beans are not roasted for long, they are a light brown shade. These beans yield a mild coffee, making it ideal for people who do not like strong flavors. \nContrary to what you may think, light roast actually has the most caffeine. After all, the longer beans are roasted, the more caffeine is destroyed.\n\nMedium Roast:\n\nMedium roast beans have a medium brown color. They are the most popular choice in the U.S., earning them the nickname of “American roast.” \nIf you take it up a notch, there is also a medium-dark roast. This one is darker with a faint bittersweet aftertaste.\n\nDark Roast:\n\nBeans roasted for a long time are called dark roast. The beans are so dark that they are basically black. \nCoffee made with dark roast beans is very bitter and has the most flavor. \nThe specific taste will differ depending on the type of plant. \nDark roast also has the least caffeine, since most of it is cooked off.\n\nSpecific caffeine levels will depend on the type of coffee. Preparation also matters, so make sure you are up to date with your coffee  brewing techniques.\nHowever, an average 8-ounce cup of coffee can have anywhere from 75 to 20 milligrams of caffeine. \nDecaffeinated coffee has just 2 to 12 milligrams per 8-ounce cup.\n\nClassic Coffee Drinks\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nEspresso\n\nHave you ever noticed those tiny cups at a café? That is espresso, a coffee served in “shot” form. \nThey might look small, but they pack a lot of punch. \nIn just 1 to 2 ounces, each espresso has 75 to 100 milligrams of caffeine. It also has a very intense flavor that might not appeal to everyone. \nEspresso calls for very hot water, a short brew time of 20 to 30 seconds, and a super fine grind.\nBut since it is best made right before serving, practice and experience are necessary for an awesome cup. You can learn how to make the perfect espresso in a few, simple steps.\nPlus, a shot (or two or three) can be added to coffee for a strong drink.\n\nAmericano\n\nIf you cross an espresso with a normal cup of coffee, you have an Americano. \nTo make one, hot water is added to espresso at a 1:1 ratio. This creates a frothy layer on top. \nMilk, cream, or more water can be added to adjust the strength.\n\nMacchiato\n\nWhen an espresso is topped with a layer of milk foam, a macchiato is born. \nIn Italian, macchiato means “marked,” emphasizing just how little milk foam is used.\n\nCappuccino\n\nA cappuccino is made by combining equal amounts of milk and espresso. The milk is frothed into a “microfoam” and poured over the espresso. \nBaristas use a foaming wand on an espresso machine to make that microfoam. \nYou can also make it at home by shaking a jar of milk and microwaving it for 20 to 30 seconds.\n\nLatte\n\nTo make a latte, a 2:1 ratio of milk and espresso is used. The milk is steamed instead of frothed. \nThis is added to the top of the espresso, along with any milk foam that is made in the process.\nSome creative baristas like to use this foam to make fun designs. \nJust do a quick search for “latte art” and you will find tons of photos! \nWhen all is said and done, an 8-ounce latte can have 63 to 175 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nMocha\n\nIf you love sweet treats, this one is for you. A mocha is made with espresso, slightly less steamed milk, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup.\nYou can also use hot chocolate mix, cocoa powder, or a mocha syrup made with ingredients like cocoa powder, vanilla, and sugar. \nWhen ready, a mocha is quite delectable. It can have 63 to 175 mg of caffeine in an 8-ounce cup.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\n\n\nDuring the summertime, macchiatos, cappuccinos, lattes, and mochas can be made into blended frozen drinks. \nAny of these drinks – both hot and cold – can be customized to your taste depending on the type of beans and milk used. \nYou can even use non-dairy milks like coconut or soy milk. But keep in mind that consistency or frothing might differ.\n\nThe world of coffee is extremely diverse. So, do not be afraid to experiment and try new things. You might just find something that your taste buds love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYKIRSTEN NUNEZ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKirsten Nunez is a lifestyle author based out of New York.

Avoid using wood, so you don’t have any issues with wood rot.\n\nPlant Liners: Any non-floating plant will need to be housed in a soil-filled plant liner to prevent your potted pond from being clouded with dirt. \nAs far as specific recommendations go, Smart Pots are flexible, water-tolerant pots that make a great potted pond plant liner.\n\nSoil: A high-quality topsoil and some gravel to cover it with is more than enough to keep your plants alive.\n\nPlants: Aquatic plants are split into two categories: floating and potted. The specific plants you should use are covered in more detail below.\n\nWater Bubbler (optional): These are a nice touch if you want to add a fountain-like effect to your pond.\n\nPlastic Sheeting (optional): You may need to line your pot with plastic sheeting if you fear leaks and cracks, or are simply using a pot made of a very porous material.\n\nAssembly of your potted pond is simple:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLine your pot with plastic sheeting, if applicable\n\t\t\tPot your plants with good topsoil, and add gravel on top to prevent soil leakage\n\t\t\tPlace your plants in your pot\n\t\t\tAdd fresh water to your pot\n\t\t\tAdd floating aquatic plants to the top of your pot\n\t\t\tAdd your water feature, if you decide to use one\n\t\t\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it. Try to place your potted pond in an area that gets sun in the morning but isn’t blasted by the sun’s rays all day long. \nThis protects the sensitive aquatic plants from being burned, as well as reduces the amount of water your pond loses every day to evaporation.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nOnce you’ve gathered the raw materials for your potted pond, you need to select the right plants. \nThere are two categories of aquatic plants: floating plants and potted plants. \nIt’s a good idea to have a mixture of these two categories to add variety to your garden and not overcrowd the pot.\n\nPotted Aquatic Plants\n\nPotted aquatic plants are simply plants that do well in extremely wet environments, but still must draw their nutrition from soil of some kind. \nThese are the ones that must go in your plant liners and then be placed in your potted pond.\n\nTwo popular potted aquatic plants are:\n\nIris: These are absolutely beautiful and, in addition their beauty, also have a toxin-reducing effect on the water in your potted pond.\n\nNymphaea Odorata: For small ponds, this dwarf waterlily is a nice touch. \nIt won’t overshadow other plants in the pot, but has a pretty white-and-yellow flower that accents the pot nicely.\n\nFloating Aquatic Plants\n\nAs their name suggests, floating aquatic plants aren’t tethered to soil in any way – they get all of their nutrition from the water. \nThey tend to take over the surface of the water, so be careful not to overuse these in your potted pond.\n\n\n\nWater Hyacinth: Produces gorgeous light-violet sets of flowers, but can also invade the surface of your pot unless you prune it. Can grow up to 3 feet tall if left unchecked.\n\nWater Lettuce: A unique floating plant that looks exactly like floating heads of lettuce. \nLike the water hyacinth, it too grows quickly and can use a lot of nutrients in the water, so prune aggressively.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPotted ponds don’t require too much care to keep them in shape. \nHowever, there are a few key tasks you must stay on top of if you want your potted pond to look amazing for as long as possible.\n\nFertilizing: Because the floating aquatic plants in your water aren’t drawing nutrition from soil, you will need to fertilize your pot from time to time. \nThis is as simple as using a water fertilizer tablet that you can pick up from most gardening stores.\n\nDraining: Over time, plant matter will build up in the bottom of your pot. \nOnce it’s over 2 inches thick, it’s time to drain your pot, clear out the dead plant matter, \ngive your pot a good scrub, and then add water back to the system.\n\nTopping Off: Unless you live in a rainy climate, you’ll need to top your pot off with fresh water a few times a week. \nIn the driest climates, you may need to top off once or even twice a day. \nMost beginners forget this step and kill off their plants simply because there’s not enough water left in the pot to nourish them.\n\nPests: There aren’t too many pests that plague a potted pond, but mosquitos can be an issue. \nThe wet, humid environment is a perfect feeding ground for them. \nThe best way to prevent or control for mosquitos is to use a product called a “mosquito dunk.” \nYou simply place it on the surface of the water and it will attract and kill mosquitos.\n\nNo matter what your level of experience is in gardening, a potted pond is a wonderful way to add variety and spice to your garden. \nIt’s also a great way to get into ornamental gardening if you typically grow fruits, veggies, and herbs. Give it a try!\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYKEVIN ESPIRITU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Espiritu runs the gardening site Epicgardening.com, where he aims to demystify the secrets of the green thumb.

For some people, the list could be whittled down to simply duct tape. \nIts adhesive capabilities and waterproof exterior make it one of the most dextrous tools you can carry; in a pinch, \nit can be used to build a shelter and create snares to catch food. Try turning a freeze-dried meal into a tent or vice versa! \nIf you aren't sold on the wonders of duct tape, here are fifteen reasons to bring a roll on your next wilderness expedition (and a few tips for how to keep your stash of tape organized and safe from the elements).\n\nHow to Pack It\n\nOn a backcountry trip, you won't be happy carting around an entire roll of duct tape, replete with the inner cardboard roll: it's heavy, it's bulky, \nthe cardboard will disintegrate when it gets wet, and the roll takes up an inordinate amount of space. \nHere are a few techniques for efficiently packing duct tape to bring on your next trip.\n\nFlat Wrap\n\nA little time consuming, but with a nice, compact final product. Simply start unrolling a little of the tape. \nWhen you have about 4 inches unspooled, fold the tape back on itself so you have two sides that are not sticky. \nKeep folding the tape on top of itself until you have the amount you need for your trip. \nPack the duct tape in a ziplock bag to keep it from sticking to other things in your pack.\n\nSpool\n\nThis is a common trick used by people who hike with trekking poles. \nStart by holding the trekking pole sideways so that it's easier to work with the tape. \nThen wrap the duct tape around the trekking pole until you have the desired amount. \nIf you don't like a thick roll of tape, consider wrapping half on one pole and half on the other.\n\nHalf Spool\n\nFor little fixes, it's nice to have a thin strip of duct tape, rather than the bulky width of the tape on the roll. \nTo create a half spool, find something round, like a tent pole splint or a pencil. \nUsing a sharp blade, slice the duct tape on the roll so that you have either two or three equal widths of tape; \nif you score all the way around the roll, it's a lot easier to pull off. Start rolling one strip around the pencil until you have enough.\n\nMix it Up\n\nDuct tape now comes in a variety of colors and patterns, all of which have the same strength and stickiness of the original silver tape. \nIf you're hunting, pick up some camo-colored tape (or hunter orange for making yourself visible). \nIf you're wrapping tape around trekking poles, having two different colors of tape can help differentiate the two poles. \nIf you anticipate using the tape to mend clothing, tents, or other wearable items, black, blue, or dark green make more discreet patches than the bright silver. \nNeon shades work especially well for marking trails because they show up so much better than silver or dark colors.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFix Things\n\nThe original purpose of duct tape was to make repairs. \nThis is one of its best applications in the wilderness, where supplies are limited and multi-purpose items are priceless.\n\nFix Your Gear\n\nBroken Ski\n\nA broken ski can be a huge hindrance, especially if you're far from your car. \nDuct tape can be used for an easy fix, whether it's a nordic or downhill set up. \nUsing a thin tree branch as a splint, tightly wrap duct tape around the stick and both pieces of broken ski.\n\nRepair a Tent (pole)\n\nA broken tent pole can be detrimental to an extended camping trip. \nEven if your tent came with a splint for a broken pole, duct tape is a lot easier to use. \nPlace the broken ends side by side, so they overlap, and wrap them tightly with tape.\n\nInflatable Mattress\n\nNothing is quite as pernicious as a leaky inflatable mattress. \nIn a pinch, a circular duct tape patch will keep the air from escaping while you sleep through the night. \nBe sure to clean the area around the patch before placing the tape to make a better seal.\n\nRepair Clothes\n\nRips, tears, shredded cuffs, all of these can easily be fixed with some masterfully placed duct tape. \nFor rips, use a round piece of tape because the lack of corners makes it more likely to stay in place. For cuffs, fold a piece over the edge and press it smooth.\n\nRepair Sunglasses\n\nBroken ear piece, loose lenses, snapped nose bridge: these are just some of the ways in which sunglasses can break at the more inopportune time. \nDuct tape can be used to fix all of these problems, whether it means wrapping the nose bridge in a thin strip, \nwrapping the ear piece with a wide piece, or carefully outlining the lens with tape to keep it from falling out.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nFix Yourself\n\nBand Aid\n\nIt may not have the same padding, but duct tape will keep a wound dry while keeping dirt and other detritus from causing an infection.\n\nAnkle Wrap\n\nThough not as flexible as athletic tape, duct tape will make a useable ankle wrap in a pinch. \nWrap the tape with the sticky side out to prevent tearing skin away when the wrap is removed.\n\nPrevent Snow Blindness\n\nForgot your glacier glasses in Base Camp? Duct tape can be used to make improvised sunglasses that will help prevent snow blindness and other eye injuries from bright sun on snow or water. \nSimply cut a width of duct tape (or two) that will extend across your face and make two very narrow slits where your eyes line up with the tape.\n\nTick-proof\n\nIn deep weeds or grasses where ticks are prevalent, it's vital to seal all entrances to bare skin. \nWrap duct tape around the bottom of your pants and tops of your socks to keep ticks from slipping through while you walk.\n\nCover Bug Bites\n\nSome bug bites react well to being covered with tape, especially chigger bites. If you're getting plagued by bug bites, use duct tape to cover the itchy bites and prevent worse damage.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPrevent Things from Breaking\n\nDuct tape is perfect for preemptive use on gear that could get damaged.\n\nPants Cuff Care\n\nHow many pairs of hiking pants or rain pants have you seen with blown out cuffs? It's easy to ruin a pair of expensive pants by walking on the cuff. \nTo prevent fraying, use a piece of duct tape to reinforce the hem. This is especially useful for rain pants, which are expensive to replace.\n\nWaterproof Map Case\n\nDuct tape is an inexpensive way to waterproof papers and other items that need to be protected from the rain. \nTo make a map case, start by cutting two pieces of cardboard to match the size of your map or other papers. \nOnce you're created the template, cover the cardboard with stripe of duct tape. \nBe sure to overlap the edges of each piece to make it extra waterproof.\n\nDry Bag For Electronics\n\nUsing the same process described above, you can easily create a waterproof case for your electronics (everything from a smart phone to a satellite phone).\n\nHide-a-Key\n\nIt's the last day of your wilderness trip and you're back at the trail head exploding your back in search of the car key. \nNext time, use a piece of duct tape to secure your key under the car. That way you don't have to worry about losing it in the woods or a lake.\n\nMark a Trail\n\nBright strips of duct tape can be used to flag a trail through the woods so that you or others can follow the path without getting lost.\n\nA roll of duct tape and some creativity will go a long way toward relieving a stressful situation in the wilderness. \nAlways pack more tape than you think you'll need and don't be afraid to experiment with bold ideas; \nwhen duct tape first came out on the market it was used on weapons, military vehicles, and boots. There is no situation too sticky for some duct tape.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYALISON HUDSON\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlison Hudson is a field instructor for the National Outdoor Leadership School, where she imparts her outdoors knowledge of backcountry and frontcountry camping on students.

When it happens, our private spaces are turned upside-down, our goods are stolen, and our families are placed in the path of danger.\n\nBut this does not have to happen; it is not an inevitability. By incorporating a few simple do-it-yourself home safety techniques with the most critical measure of all – \nthe reliable home security system – your house can be the one that the burglar bypasses in favor of the less prepared, less secure house down the street.\n\nPinpointing Your Insecure Areas\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nHome invasion is a highly researched topic among criminologists and runs along fairly predictable patterns. \nBecause of this, you can make the statistics work to your advantage.\n\nBurglars spend, on average, between eight and ten minutes in homes, and they want items that they can quickly liquidate after the invasion. Consider investing in home security to keep your items safe. \n\nTop 5 Goods That Burglars Seek\n\nFirst understanding what items burglars want is key to understanding where they want to find them:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCash: Loose currency laying around your home is the most valuable item to a burglar because it is the one thing that does not have to be liquidated.\n\t\t\tJewelry: Jewelry can be easily pawned for cash. Roughly 68 percent of burglars report that jewelry is the second most favorite item, after cash.\n\t\t\tIllegal Drugs: Illegal drugs – marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and meth – can be used by the burglar, bartered, or resold on the black market.\n\t\t\tElectronics: Except for cell phones and laptops, most electronics are bulky and provide less interest for burglars. Only about half of burglars report that they seek electronic items.\n\t\t\tPrescription Drugs: Painkillers, such as OxyContin, are valued by burglars.\n\t\t\n\n\nMost Common Burglary Entry Points\n\nIn order to gain these valuables, the burglar needs to have an entry point into your home. \nConvicted offenders have reported to researchers the following locations as their favorite places to get into a home:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFront door (34%)\n\t\t\tFirst floor window (23%)\n\t\t\tBack door (22%)\n\t\t\tGarage (9%)\n\t\t\tUnlocked entrances and storage areas (6%)\n\t\t\tBasement (4%)\n\t\t\tSecond story (2%)\n\t\t\n\n\nOnce the burglar has entered the home, he or she tends to focus on three areas. \nBy not storing your valuables in these areas, you place an obstacle in the path of the burglar’s mission:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDresser drawer: Many homeowners keep jewelry on their dresser or tucked away under clothing within a dresser drawer.\n\t\t\tBedroom closet: The bedroom closet is another place where homeowners tend to store cash, jewelry, furs, and larger valuables.\n\t\t\tFreezer: It is a long-held belief that the freezer is such an unlikely place to store cash, jewelry, or drugs that a burglar would never look there. Statistics prove otherwise. Check out these simple tips to increase your home’s security.\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWhat You Can Do Yourself to Improve Home Security\n\nMany do-it-yourself security techniques are quite simple and can be accomplished at a low or even no cost:\n\nReplace Hidden Keys with Keyless Entry Systems\n\nIf you can think of a perfect place to hide a house key, a burglar has already thought of it: \nmagnetically attached to the underside of cars, under the front mat, under real or artificial rocks, \nor inside the mailbox. Instead, give a house key to a trusted neighbor.\n\n\n\nClear Landscaping from Around the House\n\nBushes, trees, and ivy planted close to the house are never a good idea, as they increase moisture contact against your siding and foundation.\n\nInvasive landscaping is doubly bad, though, as it provides an excellent hiding place \nfor burglars trying to break into windows. Solution: cut back landscaping at least three feet from the home.\n\nAdd Deadbolts and Improve Locks\n\nKeyed knobs or levers are easy to pick or force open. Adding a deadbolt means that the burglar now has to pick two locks – a frustration that few will take on.\n\nPlus, deadbolts make it virtually impossible to physically force open a door. Deadbolts are available in both keyed and keyless forms.\n\nAdd or Maintain Outdoor Lighting\n\nIntruders rely on secrecy, and good outdoor lighting obliterates that secrecy.\n\nHire an electrician to install exterior, motion-activated lighting high up on the sides and back of your house.\n\nKeep those lights maintained by regularly cleaning the motion sensor (dirt and debris will render it inactive) and by changing out bulbs when they burn out.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nInstall Burglar Resistant Windows\n\nSince burglars enter homes through the windows nearly 25 percent of the time, it is wise to concentrate on beefing up window security.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tInstall windows with high-impact tempered glass or polycarbonate glazing.\n\t\t\tAdd metal window grilles.\n\t\t\tInstall additional window locks. These add-ons are inexpensive and work in concert with your existing window locks.\n\t\t\tPurchase and install window alarms. Cheap and simple to install, these battery-powered units emit a shrieking sound when the two halves are separated.\n\t\t\n\n\nVideo Surveillance Systems and Apps\n\nWi-Fi and the prevalence of the Internet has made it possible for you to literally keep an eye on your home while away.\n\nRanging in price between $200 and $400, self-installed video surveillance packages come with between four and sixteen exterior-ready cameras, \na DVR that records several hours of video at up to 1080 pixel clarity, and a full complement of wiring.\n\nMost systems today include access to proprietary apps and websites that allow you to observe your home from afar – all with a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop.\n\nYour Most Powerful Weapon of All: A Home Security System\n\nInstalling a home security system is the single most important action you can take to keep your home secure from invasion.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the University of North Carolina’s Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, \n“[a]bout 60% of the burglars [in the study] indicated that the presence of an alarm would cause them to seek an alternative target altogether.”\n\nThe best – and most expensive – home security systems involve a combination of hardware that is professionally installed in your home plus offsite 24/7 monitoring.\n\nMonitored Security System Features\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHardware is installed by technicians from the company – not by you.\n\t\t\tInstallation costs range around $100 to $200. Often, companies will run free installation specials.\n\t\t\tContinuous monitoring means that police will be called at any time of the day or night. You do not have to keep an eye on your home.\n\t\t\tMulti-year monthly service contracts are usually required. Costs range from $15 to $45 per month.\n\t\t\tHardware may include window and door intrusion sensors, cameras, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors, water freeze sensors, and life safety monitors (panic and medical alert buttons).\n\t\t\tCellular monitoring: This refers to systems that communicate cellularly with a monitoring station – not with a landline or broadband connection.\n\t\t\tAlarm warning stickers and signs.\n\t\t\tRepresentative brands: ADT, Xfinitiy, SimpliSafe, and FrontPoint.\n\t\t\n\n\nNon-Monitored (DIY) Security System Features\n\nOther home security systems offer self-installed hardware packages that are often on par with monitored systems’ hardware. The chief difference is that these systems are self-monitored.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYou install the hardware.\n\t\t\tNo installation costs and no monthly service fees.\n\t\t\tHardware cost: around $100 to $260.\n\t\t\tExpandable hardware packages that start with the basics, such as opening intrusion sensors, cameras, passive motion detectors, and key fobs to turn the system on/off. Additional items include video cameras, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and panic buttons.\n\t\t\tAuto-dials your phone in case of intrusion.\n\t\t\tAlarm warning stickers to display on your home.\n\t\t\tOften requires a landline connection.\n\t\t\tRepresentative brands: Blink, Vinker, and Fortress.\n\t\t\n\n\nA secure home can be achieved by combining simple do-it-yourself methods with the most important method of all – a home security system.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYLEE WALLENDER\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLee Wallender transformed a World War I-era farmhouse into a comfortable new home, and that's when he fell in love with remodeling.

It’s right up there between pumpkin pie and hot chocolate. This year, try brining a turkey in your own kitchen. \nThis process is excellent for retaining as much moisture as possible. One can only use so much gravy, after all.\n\nThankfully, brining a turkey isn’t rocket science. It is a simple process that requires basic techniques and a little patience. \nThe payoff? A juicy, delicious meal that encompasses everything we love about this time of year. Holiday cooking has never tasted so good.\n\nWhat is a Brine?\n\nCharacterized by high salt content, a brine is a solution that moistens the turkey while adding a flavorful punch. The turkey sits in the brine overnight for 8-12 hours. The secret lies within the salt, which denatures – or dissolves – \nsome of the muscle proteins of the turkey. As a result, the meat is able to stay juicy longer. Learn more about water-based brine vs dry brine.\n\nYet, it’s important to note that a brine is not the same as a marinade. The ultimate goal of a brine is to add moisture, while a marinade solely adds flavor. And while a brine can certainly wake up your taste buds, its main purpose is to increase moisture.\n\nThis is especially useful for lean meats, such as turkey, which are more susceptible to drying out. In fact, brining can increase moisture up to 15 percent. It might be exactly what you need to transform your party menu.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nBrine Recipes \n\nReady to brine your own turkey? Follow one of these recipes for a small turkey up to 12 pounds. For larger turkeys up to 20 pounds, double the recipe. Prep time will take no more than 15 minutes.\n\nSimple Brine: Back to Basics\n\nThis version is the simplest of brines. It features the two most important components for a brine: liquid and salt. This basic brine is ideal if you’re feeding a crowd of picky eaters!\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1 gallon water\n\t\t\t1 cup kosher salt or smoked coarse sea salt\n\t\t\n\n\nApple Cider Brine: Sweet Version\n\nFeel free to experiment with extra aromatics and ingredients. These additions can give a standard brine a tasty spin, but they aren’t necessary. \nThis particular version features quintessential autumn notes such as cinnamon and rosemary. To guarantee the best flavor possible, use an entire gallon of apple cider; do not mix it with water.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t1 gallon apple cider \n            1 cup kosher salt\n            ½ cup light brown sugar\n            3-4 cinnamon sticks\n            1-2 tablespoons dried cranberries\n            3-4 stalks fresh rosemary \n            Zest of one orange \n    \n\n\nVegetable Stock Brine: Savory Version\n\nTake it up a notch with fresh herbs, peppercorns, and mustard seeds. This savory brine is ideal for giving your turkey dinner an extra kick.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t1 gallon vegetable stock \n            1 cup smoked coarse sea salt\n            1 tablespoon dried fresh sage\n            1 tablespoon dried fresh oregano\n            1 tablespoon dried fresh thyme \n            2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns\n            1 tablespoon mustard seeds \n            1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nSupplies:\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tLarge pot (for prep)\n\t\t\tLarge brining bag, large pot or food-grade plastic, stainless steel, or glass container that can fit in the fridge\n\t\n\n\nRemember, the turkey must be fully submerged in liquid while it sits in the fridge. Double-check that your bag or container is big enough to accommodate the entire turkey.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nInstructions:\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tRemove giblets and neck (can be used for stock) and liver (can be used for stuffing).\n\t\t\tThoroughly rinse inside and out.\n\t\t\tFor a basic brine, mix the salt and water together in a large pot until the salt dissolves. If you’re adding extra ingredients, heat ½ gallon of the liquid and add the salt and other ingredients. Once the salt (and sugar, if applicable) is totally dissolved, turn the heat off. Let cool and add the remaining ½ gallon of liquid.\n\t\t\tAdd the cooled brine to the bag or container. Add the turkey. If the pot you are using to prep the brine is big enough to hold the turkey, you can add it directly to the pot.\n\t\t\tPlace in refrigerator for 8-12 hours, but no more than 18 hours.\n\t\t\tPat completely dry and place back in the refrigerator until the surface is totally dry. If desired, rub skin with butter or oil to encourage browning.\n\t\t\tYour turkey is ready to roast!\n\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nBrining Tips\n\nWhile brining doesn’t require fancy skills or ingredients, there are several important aspects that you should keep in mind. \nAt first glance, these concepts might seem unimportant or trivial; however, they will make a huge difference in successfully brining a turkey.\n\nFresh is Best: For optimal results, brine only fresh turkeys. Many frozen turkeys have already been injected with salt solutions, making it unnecessary to create a brine. A fresh turkey gives you a “blank canvas” to work with.\n\nSkip the Fancy: Do not use enhanced, kosher, or self-basting turkeys. These have already been brined.\n\nConcentrate on Concentration: Focus more on the salt-to-liquid ratio instead of the salt-to-turkey ratio. There must be enough salt added to the liquid to create a saturated, salty solution.\n\nIt Takes Two: Feeding a large crowd? Brine two separate turkeys instead of a single large one for a more even roast.\n\nShow Support: Place the brining bag in an aluminum foil pan or sturdy container while it is in the refrigerator. This will keep the bag and liquid in place.\n\nKeep It Covered: The turkey must be completely submerged during the 8-12 hours [1]. This will ensure complete and even moisture throughout the turkey.\n\nToss It Out: For safety reasons, discard the brine. Do not reuse.\n\nWatch the Clock: Do not leave the turkey in the brine for more than 18 hours. This will result in an undesirable spongy texture.\n\nCooking Tips\n\nThe weight of a turkey is the most important factor to pay attention to. Otherwise, you may undercook (or overcook) the turkey. \nBy taking note of the exact weight, you can determine the best cooking time to ensure that the turkey is roasted to perfection. Here are more tips on perfecting your brining skills.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYKIRSTEN NUNEZ\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKirsten Nunez is a lifestyle author based out of New York.

The concept of a CSA is beneficial on many levels, both for farms and for consumers. In a nutshell, CSA works to offer shares to members of their communities for a (usually quite reasonable) set price. In return, the customer receives a box of fresh, seasonal produce at regular intervals, usually weekly or monthly.\n    This arrangement is beneficial to farmers who work in an industry where it is normal for fluctuations in their business to occur. It gives farmers a baseline of support throughout the year, and can help them with cash flow ahead of their usual harvest.\n    CSAs benefit consumers by providing them with fresh, local produce at a reasonable price. As our lives get busier, it only gets harder to make time for thoughtful grocery shopping, where you try to get a healthy mix of fruits and vegetables. Eliminating that task is a big time-saver.

There's a reason arachnophobia is one of the most well-known technical names for a fear. Perhaps by reading our guide to spiders, we can help alleviate some of those fears by defining the unfamiliar.\n    It turns out, not all spiders are alike. Some of the more scary-looking spiders are known as hunting spiders, and these types shouldn't be coming indoors, although they do make it in at times. We break down each species so you know what you're dealing with. The more commons ones you'll find in your house are considered web-building spiders, which is where the cobweb-laden haunted house image comes from. Different types of web-building spiders will gravitate to different areas of your home, such as the attic or basement.\n    The best way to keep your home spider-free is to enact some measures for prevention. We have some good guidelines to follow, such as making sure windows and doors are tightly fitted, removing cobwebs as soon as you spot them, and even simple tasks like keeping the porch light off to deter the type of insects that spiders feed on.\n\tRead all of our tips on keeping spiders at bay, and soon you'll have nothing to fear!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/keep-spiders-out-of-the-house/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/19820/common-household-spiders.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Creepy Crawlies:\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON October 19, 2016\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaunder Like a Boss:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNever ruin a delicate sweater again!

The little symbols seem to convey important information, but what do they mean? Our laundry guide breaks down the meaning of each symbol, some of which are very similar-looking, only differentiated by small dots that explain at which temperature to launder your clothes. We also included tips for symbols that refer to dry cleaning, bleaching, and ironing.\n    This is especially important as we purchase more clothing from diverse manufacturers with tags written in a different language. Or when your cut off a poorly-placed itchy tag the first time you wear it and are left with no clues on how to launder your garment.\n    It's usually a safe bet to wash your clothes in cold water, and there are even detergents geared towards using cold water exclusively. But when you need to get something really clean with a hot wash, it's nice to know what the heat limit is for your clothes. Read our guide and never worry again about washing, drying, ironing, or bleaching your clothing incorrectly. Or better yet, print out a copy and hang it in your laundry room!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/how-to-read-clothing-laundry-tags/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/19817/launder-like-a-boss.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Launder Like a Boss:\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON October 19, 2016\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreepy Crawlies:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our guide to common household spiders, and where they like to hang out...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHostess Guide:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet the basics of hosting down with our guide to table settings.

But how much do you know about butternut squash, pumpkin’s cooler older cousin? This underrated alternative is fall’s best kept secret.\n\nLike pumpkins, butternut squash grows on vines and boasts a rich, orange inside. Both are types of squashes; butternut squash is actually known as “butternut pumpkin” in Australia and New Zealand. \nHowever, butternut squash is easier to work with than pumpkin, and since it can be used in sweet and savory meals, butternut squash is the perfect ingredient for fall grub. \nIt comes down to the right mindset and approach. Keep reading to learn all about butternut squash; before you know it, you’ll be a pro at autumn cooking.\n\nHow to Make Butternut Squash Puree\n\nAt first, working with butternut squash might seem like an intimidating task. However, with a few simple skills, cooking with this flavorful ingredient can seriously transform your holiday meals. \nWhile it is technically a fruit, butternut squash is used as a vegetable. \nLike other vegetables, it can be cut and cooked into various dishes, appetizers, and even desserts. This is just the beginning, though. \nOnce butternut squash is pureed, this fruit presents a delightful list of possibilities.\n\nTo properly puree a butternut squash, cut the squash lengthwise and remove the seeds. Position each half on a metal baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Bake for 50-60 minutes at 350 degrees F or until soft. \nOnce cool, scoop out the flesh with an ice cream scoop. Puree the flesh in a food processor. Just like that, you have created the ultimate game changer for your autumn recipes.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nPie\n\nAh, pie. It has earned its title as one of the most iconic desserts of the holidays. Between the opulent spices and comforting aromas, pie represents everything we love about this time of the year. \nSpecifically, pumpkin pie gets the most attention. The secret? Pureed pumpkin, creamed to perfection. However, you might be surprised to learn that butternut squash provides an amazing alternative.\n\nIf the thought of ditching traditional pumpkin pie makes you cringe, hear us out. This cozy treat is best made with canned pumpkin puree, pushing fresh pumpkin into second place. \nThe skin of a pumpkin is extremely tough and firm, and the flesh is fibrous, coarse, and stringy. \nBaking can help soften it, but it will never be as creamy as the canned version. Attempting to bake a pie with fresh pumpkin can be frustrating. This is where butternut squash comes to the rescue.\n\nThe skin of a butternut squash practically slides off with a vegetable peeler. The flesh is particularly smooth, making it easy to puree, and once it is pureed, it has a consistency comparable to canned pumpkin. \nThe flavor may be slightly lighter and sweeter than pumpkin, but it still delivers that squash-like autumn flavor for which it is known.\n\nThe bottom line? A pumpkin pie works best with canned puree. Otherwise, opt for butternut squash if you’d like to make a pie with fresher ingredients.\n\nPizza\n\nButternut squash can do more than make a stellar sweet treat. It can also be used in the ultimate comfort food: pizza. It’s all about experimenting with the different ways in which it can be consumed.\n\nOn its own, butternut squash offers a pleasant grain-free alternative for mini pizza crusts. It is hard enough to hold your ingredients yet soft enough to eat without too much crunch.\nTo use butternut squash as mini pizza crusts, cut the squash into rounds. \nFocus on the thicker part of the squash for the biggest slices. Of course, you can use the rest of the squash for smaller pizzas.\n\nPlace the rounds on a metal baking sheet and brush them lightly with butter or oil. Bake for 40 minutes at 400 degrees F, flipping them over halfway through. \nAdd your desired pizza toppings, such as sauce, grated cheese, olives, or chopped mushrooms. \nPop them in the oven for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese melts. This provides an awesome fall-themed finger food with treasured autumn notes.\n\nButternut squash puree can also be used as pizza sauce. It is easy to make, and it has less sodium and preservatives than many store-bought sauces. \nAmp up the flavor by adding complementary spices such as oregano and pepper. \nAgain, don’t be afraid to experiment with new flavor combinations. For the best results, apply the puree to a wheat or oat flour crust. \nThe nutty undertones will work especially well with the squash’s flavor.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nBread\n\nLike pumpkin pie, cake-like breads are traditional holiday treats. During this time of the year, banana and pumpkin breads are especially popular. \nThis year, try switching it up with butternut squash. This substitute delivers a taste that meshes well with fall spices. \nLike pie, you can ditch the canned puree and use fresh squash in a bread recipe.\n\nTo make a butternut version, replace the pumpkin puree in a bread recipe with the same amount of butternut squash. The end result will be just as moist with a daintier flavor. \nKeep in mind that pumpkin puree is also often used as an egg replacement in baked goods. This means that butternut squash can be used in a similar manner. \nTo use it as an egg substitute, simply replace each egg in a recipe with ¼ cup of butternut squash. This doesn’t have to stop at the bread, though. \nTry this technique with brownies or cake for a fall-friendly spin on conventional desserts.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n \nRoasted Seeds\n\nOften, making jack-o-lanterns is paired with a session of roasting fresh pumpkin seeds. Together, these two activities make up the picture-perfect fall afternoon. \nUnsurprisingly, the seeds from a butternut squash can also be roasted for a tasty snack. It is an awesome way to get the most out of a butternut squash. \n\nMaking a batch of roasted butternut squash seeds does not require fancy ingredients or skills. Rinse the seeds and leave them to air dry. \nToss them in olive oil and salt. You can also add other herbs, such as rosemary and oregano, for a savory version.\n\nTo make a sweet option, toss the seeds in melted butter, vanilla, and nutmeg. Use this opportunity to experiment with your favorite flavors to make a creation that is all your own. \nNext, spread the seeds on a baking sheet and cook them at 275 degrees for 40 minutes or until golden. Once they have cooled down, toss them in salad, pasta, or rice. \nCombine them with roasted pumpkin seeds, caramel chips, dried cranberries, and almonds to make an autumn trail mix. Of course, you can also eat the seeds alone and savor their simplicity.\n\n\nLattes\n\nEvery holiday season, the pumpkin spice latte steals the spotlight. Some might even say it has a cult following unrivaled by the traditional roster of seasonal beverages. \nWhile pumpkin has a tried-and-true spot in our hearts, butternut squash offers a tasty alternative. \nIt provides an excellent opportunity to try something new while preserving that quintessential fall flavor.\n\nFortunately, you don’t need to be a hip barista to make a butternut squash latte. Over medium heat, combine one cup of black coffee, ¼ cup of butternut squash puree (to taste), \n1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup, and 3-5 tablespoons of milk in a pot. \nSprinkles in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Stir until blended together. Top off the beverage with whipped cream and another sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nWith these tasty ideas, you can incorporate butternut squash into your arsenal of fall ingredients.

But this intimidating culinary experience really comes down to a few simple guidelines, and your own preferences.\n    In our infographic we break down the more common types of cheese, and explain how to pair them. It's not so much about pairing specific cheeses as it is putting together complimentary characteristics. So have a mix of hard and soft cheese, that range from mild to intense in flavor.\n    When putting together your actual platter, make sure not to crowd the cheeses. Let them have enough room to breathe on their own. Provide a separate knife for each cheese, and serve 1-2 ounces for each person. Finally, arrange the cheeses in order from the fresh and light ones such as mozzarella, to the more ripe ones such as blue cheese.\n\tRead our guide for more tips on arranging a cheese platter, as well as some fun cheese facts.

It almost has a gravitational pull, so it makes sense to acknowledge that the kitchen has a unique energy, and to try to make sure that energy is all flowing in the right direction. That's where feng shui comes in. Rules of feng shui design can often seem indecipherable to those who are unfamiliar with the concept. Learn more about this type of design in our infographic below!\n    Feng shui is all about maximizing the flow of positive energy (Chi) in your home. The placement of certain objects or pieces of furniture is believed to greatly influence this flow. Even the shape of pieces of furniture can be influenced by feng shui, which values rounded shapes like an oval table over sharp corners.\n    If you have a hard time making design decisions in your home, using feng shui principles can be a huge help to guide you in the right direction, especially when it comes to picking a color scheme! Determine your kitchen's direction in your home, and then use our guide to find out which colors to use. Each color scheme is derived from the five Chinese elements: wind, fire, earth, metal, and water.

Portable space heaters, which are inexpensive and require no permanent installation, are a popular way to heat small areas quickly.\n\nLearn the basics of this popular supplementary heating source, along with safety recommendations and tips for optimizing performance.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Space Heater\n\nPower Source: Electric, Propane, or Kerosene\n\nMost indoor heaters draw power from an ordinary 120-volt outlet. Electricity provides safe, clean heat for your room.\n\nHowever, using electricity to power space heaters can be expensive. \nPlus, if that outlet is on an electrical circuit that is drawing power for other needs, the additional strain from the space heater may cause the circuit breaker to shut off.\n\nPropane and kerosene are cheaper energy sources for space heaters and run independently from your home electrical system. \nBecause a large majority of propane and kerosene heaters are designed for outdoor use – camping, patios, and open garages – be certain to select one that is designed for indoor use. \nThese heaters have an oxygen depletion sensor that will shut the heater off if the level of oxygen in the air drops below a safe level.\nFind the right space heater for your home!\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nRoom Coverage and Wattage\n\nThe size of the area you want to heat determines what kind of space heater you purchase. Generally, 10 watts are required for each square foot of floor area.\n\nSo for a small room, such as a 150-square-foot bedroom, you will need a 1,500-watt-rated heater. \nFifteen-hundred watts, the maximum output of most portable electric space heaters, delivers about 5,118 BTUs (British thermal units) per hour.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Run Your Space Heater?\n\nYou can easily determine how much it will cost to power an electric space heater that you are considering purchasing.\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFind the Watts: Look for the wattage listed for the heater. In this example, we will use the most common wattage, 1,500.\n\t\t\tWatts per Hour: Divide the wattage by 1,000 to determine kilowatt hour. Example:  the 1,500-watt space heater uses 1.5 kilowatts per hour (kWh).\n\t\t\tUtility Rate: Look at your most recent utility bill to see how much the power company charges you for electricity. As an example, one large metropolitan utility company charges its customers $.088594 per kWh.\n\t\t\tMultiply by Hours Used: Multiply kWh by the utility rate and the number of hours you plan to use your heater. In the example below, let’s say you wish to use the heater for three hours every night in your bedroom before you sleep.\n\t\t\n\n\n\nExample: 1.5 kWh heater x $.088594 per kWh x 3 hours = $0.40.\nThis totals about $12 per month to operate your 1,500-watt space heater for three hours before bed.\n\n\t\nThermal Core: Ceramic, Oil, or None\n\nSpace heaters that have a thermal core that radiates heat after the heating coil is turned off are more effective than heaters that have only heating coils.\n\nPortable, rolling, stand-up heaters that look like old-fashioned steam or water radiators have an inflammable oil core that retains heat for as long as half an hour after the heating element has turned off.\n\nPopular ceramic space heaters are smaller than oil-filled heaters. \nThey also have a thermal core in the form of ceramic plates attached to the heating coils. \nThe plates retain the coils’ heat, continuing to provide heat after the coils have shut off. Read more on convection vs radiant heaters.\n\nIncluded Features\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThermostat: All space heaters have a thermostat that will turn the heater off when the surrounding air reaches a set temperature.\n\t\t\tTip-Over Power Shutoff Feature:  All heaters today are required to have an internal mechanism that will shut off the heater if it tips over.\n\t\t\n\n\nOptional Features\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRemote Control: Some space heaters include a remote control that allows you to make rudimentary adjustments to the heater from across the room.\n\t\t\tTimer: Some heaters include a built-in timer that will turn off the entire heater at a certain time.\n\t\t\n\n\nPros and Cons of Space Heaters\n\nPros\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUnits are Inexpensive: Most space heaters are priced at under $100.\n\t\t\tPortable: Units can be moved to areas as needed and stored away when no longer needed.\n\t\t\tDirectional: Space heaters do a superb job of directing heat to a specific spot.\n\t\t\tWise Use of Energy: Space heaters can service small spaces while other areas of the home can be left unheated. In this sense, space heaters can be considered a wise use of energy.\n\t\t\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPoor Use of Energy: Space heaters are paradoxically both a wise and a poor method of heating a room. From the standpoint of pure energy consumption, space heaters are less efficient and more expensive than permanent HVAC systems.\n\t\t\tPotentially Dangerous: Despite improvements in product design such as tip-over power cutoff switches, thermostats, and cool-to-the-touch housings, space heaters still present a safety hazard.\n\t\t\tNoise: Fan-driven space heaters can be very loud with annoying white noise. Because the heater must be located in a confined area, it is difficult to avoid this sound.\n\t\t\n\n\n7 Basic Types of Space Heaters\n\nConvection Heaters (Radiant or Quartz)\n\nConvection heaters electrify metal coils or a halogen bulb, with a reflector to point the heat at specific areas within the room.\n\nBecause there is no fan, heat range is limited to just a few feet. On the plus side, the lack of a fan means that these units are nearly silent.\n\nConvection Fan-Style Heaters\n\nThe second most basic type of indoor space heater pushes air heated by electric coils with a small electric fan.\n\nAs soon the coils stop radiating heat, the heater quickly cools down. These are considered one of the least effective types of space heaters.\n\nCeramic Box Heaters (Convection)\n\nSimilar to the convection-only heaters, these also have fans that push air over heating elements.\n\nThe difference is that ceramic box heaters have ceramic plates that retain heat after the electric coils are no longer hot.\n\nCeramic Tower (Convection)\n\nSimilar to the ceramic box heater, except in size and shape.\n\nTower convection heaters stretch the coils and housing higher and thinner to more effectively disperse heat throughout the room.\n\nMicathermic Convection Heaters\n\nThese heaters’ electric coils make contact with large, thin sheets of mica, heating them so that they can retain warmth for a long time. No fans are involved. Learn more about  how micathermic heaters work.\n\nOne great advantage of micathermic heaters is that they can be installed flat against a wall, much like a flat-screen television, saving space and better dispersing heat within the room.\n\nAlso, micathermic heaters are better at keeping down dust than fan-driven heaters because they do not move air as vigorously. \nThis means that micathermic heaters work well for allergy sufferers and others affected by dust or moving air.\n\nOil-Filled Radiator-Style Heaters\n\nWhile permanently installed boiler-driven steam and water radiators are slowly being phased out of buildings, wheeled oil-filled electric radiators have stepped in to take their place.\n\nThe oil in this type of radiator is heated by electric elements. The oil is sealed within the radiator and never needs to be refilled. Learn more about how oil-filled heaters work. \n\nWhile energy efficient, these heaters are heavy and at risk for tipping over.\n\nPropane-Powered Indoor Heaters\n\nIndoor-safe propane heaters are highly effective, pushing out up to 9,000 BTU per hour for less money than electric heaters. Disposable propane canisters can run the heater at full blast for up to four to five hours.\n\nThese heaters emit no smell of gas. They are great for heating large areas, such as living rooms, basements, and garages.\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nHow to Use a Space Heater\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tStay Up to Date: Older space heaters may not meet newer safety standards. Ensure that your heater meets current safety standards.\n\t\t\tSet on Proper Surface: Provide a firm, level surface for the heater, such as hard flooring (tile, vinyl, wood, etc.) or a table.\n\t\t\tBuffer Zone: Clear flammable materials such as bedding, drapes, and furniture from a three-foot radius around the heater.\n\t\t\tSafety Zone: Children and pets love to explore space heaters’ glowing coils and power cords; keep them well away from the heater.\n\t\t\tDisconnect: Unplug the heater when you leave the room.\n\t\t\tNo Extensions: Plug directly into outlet; avoid extension cords.\n\t\t\tWaking Hours Only: Turn off and unplug the heater when you go to sleep.\n\t\t\tMoisture: Keep the heater away from damp areas such as showers and bathtubs.\n\t\t\tProper Fuel Type: Ensure that you use only kerosene (not gasoline) for kerosene heaters. Gasoline increases the possibility of fire.\n\t\t\tIndoor-Only Propane Heaters: Make sure that any portable propane space heaters you use indoors are specifically designed for indoor use.\n\t\t\n\n\nSaveEmbed Image\n\nTop Ways to Optimize Your Space Heater\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tKeep It Small: Confine the space; do not use in spaces that are too large for the heater.\n\t\t\tGive It Room to Do Its Job: All space heaters, except for wall-mounted heaters, require several feet of clear space around the unit for the heat to evenly and efficiently disperse throughout the room.\n\t        Correct Positioning: Follow manufacturers’ positioning requirements, especially with fan-driven directional space heaters.\n\t\t\tEnsure Clear Airflow: Clean air intake vents with a vacuum while the heater is unplugged.\n\t\t\tBe Patient: Convection heaters take more time to heat up a room than fan-driven space heaters.\n\t\t\n\n\nElectric or propane space heaters, though not the optimal way to heat a room, do provide a number of advantages over whole-house heating systems. Learn which features to look for so you can purchase the right space heater for your home, and get valuable usage, optimization, and safety tips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRITTEN BYLEE WALLENDER\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLee Wallender transformed a World War I-era farmhouse into a comfortable new home, and that's when he fell in love with remodeling.

And there is nothing worse than trying to dip your toe into the yoga pool, only to find that the class you chose is not suited to your needs. We've all been there; wanting to get a great workout and realizing that we've accidentally signed up for a class that is focused on the restorative and spiritual sides of yoga.\n    Let our infographic below dispel the notion that yoga doesn't provide a solid workout, once and for all. It is simply a matter of choosing the right class for you, such as Bikram or Vinyasa. If you're looking for a more relaxing class as a supplement to your other fitness activities, or are recovering from an injury, then Iyengar or Yin yoga may be more your speed.\n    Many yoga studios focus on a certain type of yoga, but offer a few different varieties within that niche. If you're new to yoga, you may consider trying a one-month membership, which many studios offer to new clients at a discounted rate. You can then sample different types of classes to see what you value in a class. You may like the repetition of a flow (Vinyasa) class, or prefer one that pushes the physical boundaries and challenges you to try new poses, such as Jivamukti. Either way, consult our guide first to get a better idea of what your preferences are!\n\nEmbed Image\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/find-your-perfect-yoga-practice/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/19769/find-perfect-yoga-practice.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ohm My Gosh!\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON August 23, 2016\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimple Exercises and Tips for Busy People\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you can never find the time to work out, try this routine!

Things like needing to pack a gym bag in advance and sitting in traffic on your way to the gym from work are obstacles between you and your fitness routine. That's why it is important to have a fitness routine on hand that you can perform almost anywhere. You may not have the time to get across town to the gym, but you must have 20 or 30 minutes to do a basic bodyweight routine.\n    Our guide has five exercises each for the upper and lower body. All are high-impact and designed to work as many muscle groups as possible. It's called multi-tasking! You can combine a variety of these movements to create your very own workout. Combine that with some jump-rope to get the heart rate up, and your workout is over before you know it.\n    Also included are tips for managing food cravings amidst summer party season. It is a natural instinct to want to look your best on social occasions, and to look forward to a nice spread. But that can lead to restrictive food habits, followed by bingeing on party foods after a few alcoholic beverages. Learn to break that cycle by occasionally indulging your cravings, so that you don't overdo it later.

The first step is picking out a good wok; we recommend going for a 14-inch wok that will give you enough space to cook large meals, and preferable selecting one made from carbon steel for longevity.\n    Once you have your wok, it's time to season it. This step only needs to be done once and helps develop a non-stick coating that will aid you greatly as you stir fry food in your new wok. Read our directions below for seasoning a new carbon steel wok. After the first season, it's a good idea to cook a fatty food such as bacon in the wok for your inaugural meal, as the fat will contribute to developing the non-stick coating.\n    Now that you are off and running, take this opportunity to learn some new recipes that will cook perfectly in a wok, such as Caribbean-style jerk chicken, or chili garlic beef stir fry with coconut rice, listed below. When you become a wok pro, you can begin to mix and match these recipes to develop your own creations!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/wok-guide-for-beginners/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/19815/wok-this-way.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wok This Way:\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON October 19, 2016\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhm My Gosh!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYoga practices can be vastly different, there's no one way to go about it. ...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFatten Up That Piggy Bank\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn the fundamentals of budgeting, and apply them to your own income, wha...",

That's why using our budget breakdown as a guide will help you to keep track of your spending.\n\nA budget should be specifically tailored to each person, and reflect your goals for saving, spending, or paying down debt. There is definitely flexibility in where you put your money, but there are also a few solid guidelines to follow. For example, your fixed costs that you pay each month should not be more than 50% of your take-home pay. These include bills such as cell phone, internet, rent or mortgage, and gym memberships. Our guide recommends you allocate 20% of take-home pay toward your financial goals, such as savings or paying down debt. The remaining 30% then goes toward flexible costs such as food and entertainment.\n\nOne way to tackle your monthly budget is to track your spending and then evaluate what goes where. Seeing the breakdown all at once may encourage you to limit spending in one area, such as eating out, and allocate those funds to an area where they are more needed. Read our budgeting guide, and then get started on planning your own!\n\nEmbed Image\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmbed the article on your site\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/Content/blog/the-basics-of-budgeting/\"><img src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/19763/\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Fatten Up That Piggy Bank\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/\">Partselect.com</a>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n        \n            Post\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Pin It\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Share\t\t\t\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Subscribe\n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPUBLISHED ON August 23, 2016\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRELATED ARTICLES\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaunder Like a Boss:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNever ruin a delicate sweater again!

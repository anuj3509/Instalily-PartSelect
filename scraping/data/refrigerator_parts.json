It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.",

The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.",

If your refrigerator does not defrost properly you can test both the thermostat and the heater to figure out which part is at fault.

You will find the light bulb by opening your dryer door and locating the casing surrounding the bulb on the top of the inside of the door. You will need to remove the single screw holding it in place to access the bulb. Twist the old bulb out of place. Use your pliers if the base of the bulb is still inside the socket once the glass part of the bulb has been removed. Check to make sure that the socket itself is not damaged. If the socket is damaged it will need to be replaced as well. Screw your new bulb into place.",

    "description": "Defrost Timer (60hz 120v) Specifications\n                This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.",

This part mounts in the ice dispenser, and measures approximately 3.25 inches in diameter. It is constructed of plastic and rubber, and comes in white/black. This part is sold individually.",

This white plastic frame measures approximately 12-inches wide and 16 inches long, and is used to allow the meat drawer to easily slide in and out of the fridge. If your meat drawer is currently sagging and this frame is damaged and not supporting it enough, it needs to be replaced. Replacing this frame requires you to remove the meat drawer and the glass shelf above it, so you can flip it over and slide out the old frame, and slide in the new. This frame is supplied by the original equipment manufacturer and is sold individually, so it does not include any other parts for the meat drawer or shelf above it.",

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white.

This door seal is used in two-door fridges and therefore one door seal is required for each door. The seal prevents cold air from escaping and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to maintain a consistent temperature inside. The seal is located around the perimeter of the refrigerator door. Over time, the door seal can wear out, become cracked, or lose its elasticity. A faulty door seal will lead to increased energy consumption, inconsistent temperatures, and potential spoilage of food. To replace the door seal, simply peel off the old seal, and clean the sealing area. Align the new seal along the door perimeter and press it firmly into place to create a tight seal. Each order only comes with one door seal, therefore if both of your door gaskets are faulty, you will need to order two of these.",

    "description": "Water Inlet Valve Specifications\n                If you notice that the ice maker in your refrigerator is leaking or is not making or dispensing ice, you may need to replace the water inlet valve. When energized, the water inlet valve releases water from the supply line into the ice mold. The water inlet valve is in the back of your refrigerator so you will need to pull the fridge out from the wall before completing this repair. To complete this job, you will need a 1/2 inch wrench, a 1/4 inch nut driver and a utility knife. If your old inlet valve has a screw-in fitting, you may need to simply cut the end of the hose to fit in the new part. Be sure to disconnect both the water and power supply from the refrigerator prior to beginning this repair.",

If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.",

If the end caps of your refrigerator or freezer are broken or cracked, or if your food retainer bar is not staying in place, then replacing the door support can solve this problem. No tools are needed for this repair project. To repair, first remove the end cap by pushing upward or downwards to slide it out the end of the rail. Next, replace with new end cap and line it up to clip it back onto the rail. It comes in white and measures about two inches high. Remember to wear gloves for safety.",

The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.",

It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.",

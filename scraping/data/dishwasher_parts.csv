                This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.",70.66,Whirlpool,dishwasher,https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/16744934-1-M-Whirlpool-W11612326-Circulation-Pump.jpg,https://www.partselect.com/PS16744934-Whirlpool-W11612326-Circulation-Pump.htm?SourceCode=18,,Please refer to the product manual or visit https://www.partselect.com/PS16744934-Whirlpool-W11612326-Circulation-Pump.htm?SourceCode=18#Instructions for detailed installation instructions.,"{""part_number"": ""PS16744934"", ""category"": ""dishwasher"", ""url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/PS16744934-Whirlpool-W11612326-Circulation-Pump.htm?SourceCode=18""}",True
